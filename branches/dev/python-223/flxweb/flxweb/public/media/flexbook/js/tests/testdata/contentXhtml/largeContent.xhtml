      Suppose you're taking a standardized test to get into college and you encounter a type of problem that you've never seen before. What tools could you use to help solve the problem? Is there anything you should do before trying to solve the problem? Is there anything you should do afterwards? In this Concept, you'll be presented with a step-by-step guide to problem solving and some strategies that you can use to solve any problem.

      Much of mathematics applies to real-world situations. To think critically and to problem solve are mathematical abilities. Although these capabilities may be the most challenging, they are also the most rewarding.

      To be successful in applying mathematics in real-life situations, you must have a &#8220;toolbox&#8221; of strategies to assist you. Many algebra lessons are devoted to filling this toolbox so you become a better problem solver and can tackle mathematics in the real world.

      Sometimes a certain problem is best solved by using a specific method. Most of the time, however, it can be solved by using several different strategies. When you are familiar with all of the problem-solving strategies, it is up to you to choose the methods that you are most comfortable with and that make sense to you. In this book, we will often use more than one method to solve a problem. This way we can demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of different strategies when applied to different types of problems.

      Step 2 tells us to devise a plan. Since we are given a lot of information about how the different pieces are related, it looks like we can write some algebraic expressions and equations in order to solve this problem. Let <img src="/flx/math/inline/a" alt="a" class="x-ck12-math" /> be the measure of the first angle. The second angle is twice the first, so think about how you can express that algebraically. The correct expression is <img src="/flx/math/inline/2a" alt="2a" class="x-ck12-math" />. Also, the third angle is three times the size of the first so that would be <img src="/flx/math/inline/3a" alt="3a" class="x-ck12-math" />. Now the other piece of information given to us is that all three angles must add up to 180 degrees. From this we will write an equation, adding together the expressions of the three angles and setting them equal to 180.

      Step 3 is to solve the problem. Simplifying this we get

    <p id="x-ck12-MTE4ODU4OGM1ZTUxNGY0YWJjNjdiNTkxZjE0OWY4MDk.-zar">
      Now we know that the first angle is 30 degrees, which means that the second angle is 60 degrees and the third is 90 degrees. Let's check whether these three angles add up to 180 degrees.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p id="x-ck12-MTE3MjUxY2JlMDYwMThkYmFmZWE1ZjZjYTkyNmNjYjU.-wu2">
      The three angles do add up to 180 degrees.

    <p id="x-ck12-ZmY3MmJkYWE1NjUyYTY3NGI2N2ZiM2MzMDY2ZjdjODA.-ryd">
      Step 4 is to consider other possible methods. We could have used guess and check and possibly found the correct answer. However, there are many choices we could have made. What would have been our first guess? There are so many possibilities for where to start with guess and check that solving this problem algebraically was the simplest way.
