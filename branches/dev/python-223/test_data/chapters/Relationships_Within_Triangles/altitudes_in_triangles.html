  <h2>Altitudes in Triangles</h2>

  <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Construct the altitude of a triangle.</li>

    <li>Apply the Concurrency of Altitudes Theorem to identify the
    point of concurrency of the altitudes of the triangle (the
    orthocenter).</li>

    <li>Use the Concurrency of Altitudes Theorem to solve problems
    involving the orthocenter of triangles.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>In this lesson we will conclude our discussions about special
  line segments associated with triangles by examining altitudes of
  triangles. We will learn how to find the location of a point
  within the triangle that involves the altitudes.</p>

  <h3>Definition of Altitude of a Triangle</h3>

  <p>An <strong role="strong">altitude</strong> of a triangle is
  the line segment from a vertex perpendicular to the opposite
  side. Here is an example that shows the altitude from vertex
  <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=A" alt=
  "A"> in an acute triangle.</p>

  <div><img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=678" width=
  "256px"></div>

  <p>We need to be careful with altitudes because they do not
  always lie inside the triangle. For example, if the triangle is
  obtuse, then we can easily see how an altitude would lie outside
  of the triangle. Suppose that we wished to construct the altitude
  from vertex <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=A" alt="A"> in
  the following obtuse triangle:</p>

  <div><img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=719" width=
  "256px"></div>

  <p>In order to do this, we must extend side <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Coverline%7BCB%7D"
  alt="\overline{CB}"> as follows:</p>

  <div><img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=808" width=
  "256px"></div>

  <p>Will the remaining altitudes for <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Ctriangle%20ABC"
  alt="\triangle ABC"> (those from vertices <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=B" alt="B"> and
  <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=C" alt=
  "C"> ) lie inside or outside of the triangle?</p>

  <p>Answer: The altitude from vertex <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=B" alt="B"> will
  lie inside the triangle; the altitude from vertex <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=C" alt="C"> will
  lie outside the triangle.</p>

  <div><img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=694" width=
  "256px"></div>

  <p>As was true with perpendicular bisectors (which intersect at
  the circumcenter), and angle bisectors (which intersect at the
  incenter), and medians (which intersect at the centroid), we can
  state a theorem about the altitudes of a triangle.</p>

  <p><strong role="strong">Concurrency of Triangle Altitudes
  Theorem:</strong> The altitudes of a triangle will intersect in a
  point. We call this point the <strong role=
  "strong">orthocenter</strong> of the triangle.</p>

  <p>Rather than prove the theorem, we will demonstrate it for the
  three types of triangles (acute, obtuse, and right) and then
  illustrate some applications of the theorem.</p>

  <p><strong role="strong">Acute Triangles</strong></p>

  <div><img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=795" width=
  "256px"></div>

  <p>The orthocenter lies within the triangle.</p>

  <p><strong role="strong">Obtuse Triangles</strong></p>

  <div><img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=736" width=
  "256px"></div>

  <p>The orthocenter lies outside of the triangle.</p>

  <p><strong role="strong">Right Triangles</strong></p>

  <p>The legs of the triangle are altitudes. The orthocenter lies
  at the vertex of the right angle of the triangle.</p>

  <div><img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=743" width=
  "256px"></div>

  <p>Even with these three cases, we may still encounter special
  triangles that exhibit interesting properties.</p>

  <p><strong role="strong">Example 1</strong></p>

  <p><em>Use a piece of Patty Paper (<img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=5%27%27" alt=
  "5''"> <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Ctimes" alt=
  "\times"> <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=5%27%27" alt=
  "5''"> tracing paper), or any square piece of paper to explore
  orthocenters of isosceles <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Ctriangle%20ABC"
  alt="\triangle ABC">.</em> Note: <em>Patty Paper may be purchased
  in bulk from many Internet sites.</em></p>

  <p><em>Determine any relationships between the location of the
  orthocenter and the location of the incenter, circumcenter, and
  centroid.</em></p>

  <p>First let&rsquo;s recall that you can construct an isosceles
  triangle with Patty Paper as follows:</p>

  <p>1. Draw line segment <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Coverline%7BAB%7D"
  alt="\overline{AB}">.</p>

  <div><img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=312" width=
  "256px"></div>

  <p>2. Fold point <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=A" alt="A"> onto
  point <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=B" alt="B"> to
  find the fold line.</p>

  <div><img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=800" width=
  "256px"></div>

  <p>3. Locate point <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=C" alt="C">
  anywhere on the fold line and connect point <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=C" alt="C"> to
  points <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=A" alt="A"> and
  <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=B" alt=
  "B">. (Hint: Locate point <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=C" alt="C"> as
  far away from <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=A" alt="A"> and
  <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=B" alt=
  "B"> as possible so that you end up with a good-sized triangle.).
  Trace three copies of <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Ctriangle%20ABC"
  alt="\triangle ABC"> onto Patty Paper (so that you end up with
  four sheets of paper, each showing <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Ctriangle%20ABC"
  alt="\triangle ABC">).</p>

  <div><img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=705" width=
  "256px"></div>

  <p>4. For one of the sheets, fold the paper to locate the median,
  angle bisector, and perpendicular bisector relative to the vertex
  angle at point <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=C" alt="C">.
  What do you observe? (Answer: They are the same line segment.)
  Fold to find another bisector and locate the intersection of the
  two lines, the incenter.</p>

  <p>5. For the second sheet, locate the circumcenter of <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Ctriangle%20ABC"
  alt="\triangle ABC">.</p>

  <p>6. For the third sheet, locate the centroid of <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Ctriangle%20ABC"
  alt="\triangle ABC">.</p>

  <p>7. For the third sheet, locate the orthocenter of <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Ctriangle%20ABC"
  alt="\triangle ABC">.</p>

  <p>8. Trace the location of the circumcenter, centroid, and
  orthocenter onto the original triangle. What do you observe about
  the four points? (Answer: The incenter, orthocenter,
  circumcenter, and centroids are collinear and lie on the median
  from the vertex angle.)</p>

  <div><img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=771" width=
  "256px"></div>

  <p>Do you think that the four points will be collinear for all
  other kinds of triangles? The answer is pretty interesting! In
  our homework we will construct the four points for a more general
  case.</p>

  <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>

  <p>In this lesson we:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Defined the orthocenter of a triangle.</li>

    <li>Stated the Concurrency of Altitudes Theorem.</li>

    <li>Solved problems using the Concurrency of Altitudes
    Theorem.</li>

    <li>Examined the special case of an isosceles triangle and
    determined relationships about among the incenter,
    circumcenter, centroid, and orthocenter.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Points to Consider</h3>

  <p>Remember that the altitude of a triangle is also its height
  and can be used to find the area of the triangle. The altitude is
  the shortest distance from a vertex to the opposite side.</p>

  <h3>Review Questions</h3>

  <ol start="">
    <li>In our lesson we looked at the special case of an isosceles
    triangle and determined relationships about among the incenter,
    circumcenter, centroid, and orthocenter. Explore the case of an
    equilateral triangle <img src=
    "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Ctriangle%20ABC"
    alt="\triangle ABC"> and see which (if any) relationships
    hold.</li>

    <li>Perform the same exploration for an acute triangle. What
    can you conclude?</li>

    <li>Perform the same exploration for an obtuse triangle. What
    can you conclude?</li>

    <li>Perform the same exploration for a right triangle. What can
    you conclude?</li>

    <li>What can you conclude about the four points for the general
    case of <img src=
    "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Ctriangle%20ABC"
    alt="\triangle ABC">?</li>

    <li>In 3 you found that three of the four points were
    collinear. The segment joining these three points define the
    Euler segment. Replicate the exploration of the general
    triangle case and measure the lengths of the Euler segment and
    the sub-segments. Drag your drawing so that you can investigate
    potential relationships for several different triangles. What
    can you conclude about the lengths?</li>

    <li>(Found in <strong role="strong"><em>Exploring Geometry,
    1999, Key Curriculum Press</em></strong>) Construct a triangle
    and find the Euler segment. Construct a circle centered at the
    midpoint of the Euler segment and passing through the midpoint
    of one of the sides of the triangle.

      <p>This circle is called the nine-point circle. The midpoint
      it passes through is one of the nine points. What are the
      other eight?</p>

  <h3>Review Answers</h3>

  <ol start="">
    <li>All four points are the same.</li>

    <li>The four points all lie inside the triangle.</li>

    <li>The four points all lie outside the triangle.</li>

    <li>The orthocenter lies on the vertex of the right angle and
    the circumcenter lies on the midpoint of the hypotenuse.</li>

    <li>The orthocenter, the circumcenter, and the centroid are
    always collinear.</li>

    <li>
      <ol start="">
        <li>The circumcenter and the orthocenter are the endpoints
        of the Euler segment.</li>

        <li>The distance from the orthocenter to the centroid is
        twice the distance from the centroid to the
        circumcenter.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>Three of the points are the midpoints of the
    triangle&rsquo;s sides. Three other points are the points where
    the altitudes intersect the opposite sides of the triangle. The
    last three points are the midpoints of the segments connecting
    the orthocenter with each vertex.</li>

    <li>The congruence can be proven by showing the congruence of
    triangles <img src=
    "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Ctriangle%20APB"
    alt="\triangle APB"> and <img src=
    "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Ctriangle%20DOE"
    alt="\triangle DOE">. This can be done by applying postulate
    AAS to the two triangles.</li>

    <li>The proof can be completed by using the AAS postulate to
    show that triangles <img src=
    "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Ctriangle%20CEB"
    alt="\triangle CEB"> and <img src=
    "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Ctriangle%20BDC"
    alt="\triangle BDC"> are congruent. The conclusion follows from
    CPCTC.</li>
