  <h2>Angle Bisectors in Triangles</h2>

  <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Construct the bisector of an angle.</li>

    <li>Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem to identify the point of
    concurrency of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides (the
    incenter).</li>

    <li>Use the Angle Bisector Theorem to solve problems involving
    the incenter of triangles.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>In our last lesson we examined perpendicular bisectors of the
  sides of triangles. We found that we were able to use
  perpendicular bisectors to circumscribe triangles. In this lesson
  we will learn how to inscribe circles in triangles. In order to
  do this, we need to consider the angle bisectors of the triangle.
  The bisector of an angle is the ray that divides the angle into
  two congruent angles.</p>

  <p>Here is an example of an angle bisector in an equilateral
  triangle.</p>

  <h3>Angle Bisector Theorem and its Converse</h3>

  <p>We can prove the following pair of theorems about angle
  bisectors.</p>

  <p><strong role="strong">Angle Bisector Theorem:</strong> If a
  point is on the bisector of an angle, then the point is
  equidistant from the sides of the angle.</p>

  <p>Before we proceed with the proof, let&rsquo;s recall the
  definition of the distance from a point to a line. The distance
  from a point to a line is the length of the line segment that
  passes through the point and is <em>perpendicular to the original
  line</em>.</p>

  <div><img src=

  "256px"></div>

  <p><strong role="strong">Proof</strong>. Consider <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Cangle%7BROS%7D"
  alt="\angle{ROS}"> with angle bisector <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Coverline%7BOP%7D"
  alt="\overline{OP}">, and segments <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Coverline%7BPX%7D"
  alt="\overline{PX}"> and <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Coverline%7BPY%7D"
  alt="\overline{PY}">, perpendicular to each side through point
  <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=P" alt=

  <div><img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=759" width=
  "256px"></div>

  <p>We will show that <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Coverline%7BPX%7D%20%5Ccong%20%5Coverline%7BPY%7D"
  alt="\overline{PX} \cong \overline{PY}">.</p>

  <ol start="">
    <li>Since <img src=
    "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Coverline%7BOP%7D"
    alt="\overline{OP}"> is the bisector of <img src=
    "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Cangle%7BROS%7D"
    alt="\angle{ROS}">, then <img src=
    "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Cangle%7BXOP%7D%20%5Ccong%20%5Cangle%7BYOP%7D"
    alt="\angle{XOP} \cong \angle{YOP}"> by the definition of angle
    bisector. In addition, since <img src=
    "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Coverline%7BPX%7D"
    alt="\overline{PX}"> and <img src=
    "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Coverline%7BPY%7D"
    alt="\overline{PY}"> are perpendicular to the sides of
    <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Cangle%7BROS%7D"
    alt="\angle{ROS}">, then <img src=
    "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Cangle%7BPXO%7D"
    alt="\angle{PXO}"> and <img src=
    "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Cangle%7BPYO%7D"
    alt="\angle{PYO}"> are right angles and thus congruent.
    Finally, <img src=
    "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Coverline%7BOP%7D%20%5Ccong%20%5Coverline%7BOP%7D"
    alt="\overline{OP} \cong \overline{OP}"> by the reflexive
    property.</li>

    <li>By the AAS postulate, we have <img src=
    "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Ctriangle%20PXO%20%5Ccong%20%5Ctriangle%20PYO"
    alt="\triangle PXO \cong \triangle PYO">.</li>

    <li>So <img src=
    "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Coverline%7BPX%7D%20%5Ccong%20%5Coverline%7BPY%7D"
    alt="\overline{PX} \cong \overline{PY}"> by CPCTC
    (corresponding parts of congruent triangles are congruent).

    "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Cblacklozenge"
    alt="\blacklozenge"></li>
  </ol>

  <p>Therefore <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=P" alt="P"> is
  equidistant from each side of the angle. And since <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=P" alt="P">
  represents any point on the angle bisector, we can say that
  <strong role="strong">every</strong> point on the angle bisector
  is equidistant from the sides of the angle.</p>

  <p>We can also prove the converse of this theorem.</p>

  <p><strong role="strong">Converse of the Angle Bisector
  Theorem:</strong> If a point is in the interior of an angle and
  equidistant from the sides, then it lies on the bisector of the
  angle.</p>

  <p><strong role="strong">Proof</strong>. Consider <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Cangle%7BROS%7D"
  alt="\angle{ROS}"> with points <img src=

  alt="\overline{PX} \cong \overline{PY}"> as follows:</p>

  <div><img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=794" width=
  "256px"></div>

  <ol start="">
    <li>As the distance to each side is given by the lengths of
    <img src=
    "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Coverline%7BPX%7D"
    alt="\overline{PX}"> and <img src=
    "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Coverline%7BPY%7D"
    alt="\overline{PY}"> respectively, we have that <img src=

    alt="\overline{PX}"> and <img src=
    "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Coverline%7BPY%7D"

    <li>Note that <img src=

    alt="\triangle XOP"> and <img src=

  </ol>

  <p>Notice that we just proved the Angle Bisector Theorem (If a
  point is on the angle bisector then it is equidistant from the
  sides of the angle) and we also proved the converse of the Angle
  Bisector theorem (If a point is equidistant from the sides of an
  angle then it is on the angle bisector of the triangle). When we
  have proven both a theorem and its converse we say that we have
  proven a <strong role="strong">biconditional</strong> statement.
  We can put the two conditional statements together using <em>if
  and only if</em>: "A point is on the angle bisector of an angle
  if and only if it is equidistant from the sides of the
  triangle."</p>

  <h3>Angle Bisectors in a Triangle</h3>

  <p>We will now use these theorems to prove an interesting result
  about the angle bisectors of a triangle.</p>

  <p><strong role="strong">Concurrency of Angle Bisectors
  Theorem:</strong> The angle bisectors of a triangle intersect in
  a point that is equidistant from the three sides of the
  triangle.</p>

  <p><strong role="strong">Proof</strong>. We will use the previous
  two theorems to establish the proof.</p>

  <p>1. Consider <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Ctriangle%20ABC"
  alt="\triangle ABC">.</p>

  <div><img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=687" width=
  "256px"></div>

  <p>2. We can construct the angle bisectors of <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Cangle%7BCAB%7D"
  alt="\angle{CAB}"> and <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Cangle%7BABC%7D"
  alt="\angle{ABC}"> intersecting at point <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=X" alt="X"> as
  follows.</p>

  <div><img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=680" width=
  "256px"></div>

  <p>3. We will show that point <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=X" alt="X"> is
  equidistant from sides <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Coverline%7BAB%7D"
  alt="\overline{AB}">, <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Coverline%7BBC%7D"
  alt="\overline{BC}">, and <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Coverline%7BCA%7D"
  alt="\overline{CA}"> and that <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=X" alt="X"> is
  on the bisector of <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Cangle%7BBCA%7D"
  alt="\angle{BCA}">.</p>

  <p>4. Construct perpendicular line segments from point <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=X" alt="X"> to
  sides <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Coverline%7BXR%7D%2C%20%5Coverline%7BXS%7D"
  alt="\overline{XR}, \overline{XS}">, and <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Coverline%7BXT%7D"
  alt="\overline{XT}"> as follows:</p>

  <div><img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=784" width=
  "256px"></div>

  <p>5. Since <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=X" alt="X"> is
  on the bisectors of <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Cangle%7BCAB%7D"
  alt="\angle{CAB}"> and <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Cangle%7BABC%7D"
  alt="\angle{ABC}">, then by Theorem 5-5, <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Coverline%7BXR%7D%20%5Ccong%20%5Coverline%7BXS%7D%20%5Ccong%20%5Coverline%7BXT%7D"
  alt="\overline{XR} \cong \overline{XS} \cong \overline{XT}">.
  Therefore, <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=X" alt="X"> is
  equidistant from sides <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Coverline%7BAB%7D%2C%20%5Coverline%7BBC%7D"
  alt="\overline{AB}, \overline{BC}">, and <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Coverline%7BCA%7D"
  alt="\overline{CA}">.</p>

  <p>6. Since <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=X" alt="X"> is
  equidistant from <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Coverline%7BBC%7D"
  alt="\overline{BC}"> and <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Coverline%7BCA%7D"
  alt="\overline{CA}">, Theorem 5-6 applies and we must have that
  <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=X" alt=
  "X"> is on the angle bisector of <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Cangle%7BBCA%7D"
  alt="\angle{BCA}">. <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Cblacklozenge"
  alt="\blacklozenge"></p>

  <p>The point <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=X" alt="X"> has
  a special property. Since it is equidistant from each side of the
  triangle, we can see that <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=X" alt="X"> is
  the center of a circle that lies within the triangle. We say that
  the circle is <strong role="strong">inscribed within</strong> the
  triangle and the point <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=X" alt="X"> is
  called the <strong role="strong">incenter</strong> of the
  triangle. This is illustrated in the following figure.</p>

  <div><img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=707" width=
  "256px"></div>

  <p><strong role="strong">Example 1</strong></p>

  <p><em>Inscribe the following triangle using a compass and a
  straightedge.</em></p>

  <p>1. Draw triangle <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Ctriangle%20ABC"
  alt="\triangle ABC"> with your straightedge.</p>

  <div><img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=734" width=
  "256px"></div>

  <p>2. Use your compass to construct the angle bisectors and find
  the point of concurrency <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=X" alt="X">.</p>

  <div><img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=742" width=
  "256px"></div>

  <p>3. Use your compass to construct the circle that inscribes
  <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Ctriangle%20ABC"
  alt="\triangle ABC">.</p>

  <div><img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=682" width=
  "256px"></div>

  <p><strong role="strong">Example 2</strong></p>

  <p><em>Inscribe a circle within the following triangle using The
  Geometer&rsquo;s Sketchpad.</em></p>

  <p>We can use the commands of GSP to construct the incenter and
  corresponding circle as follows:</p>

  <p>1. Open a new sketch and construct triangle <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Ctriangle%20ABC"
  alt="\triangle ABC"> using the Segment Tool.</p>

  <div><img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=676" width=
  "256px"></div>

  <p>2. You can construct the angle bisectors of the angles by
  first designating the angle by selecting the appropriate vertices
  (e.g., to select the angle at vertex <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=A" alt="A">,
  select points <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=B" alt="B">,
  <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=A" alt=
  "A"> and <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=C" alt="C"> in
  order) and then choosing Construct Angle Bisector from the
  Construct menu. After bisecting two angles, construct the point
  of intersection by selecting each angle bisector and choosing
  Intersection from the Construct menu. (Recall from our proof of
  the concurrency of angle bisectors theorem that we only need to
  bisect two of the angles to find the incenter.)</p>

  <div><img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=726" width=
  "256px"></div>

  <p>3. You are now ready to construct the circle. Recall that the
  radius of the circle must be the distance from <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=X" alt="X"> to
  each side &ndash; our figure above does not include that segment.
  However, we do not need to construct the perpendicular line
  segments as we did to prove Theorem 5-7. Sketchpad will measure
  the distance for us.</p>

  <p>4. To measure the distance from <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=X" alt="X"> to
  each side, select point <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=X" alt="X"> and
  one side of the triangle. Choose Distance from the Measure menu.
  This will give you the radius of your circle.</p>

  <div><img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=722" width=
  "256px"></div>

  <p>5. We are now ready to construct the circle. Select point
  <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=X" alt=
  "X"> and the distance from <img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=X" alt="X"> to
  the side of the triangle. Select &ldquo;Construct circle by
  center + radius&rdquo; from the Construct menu. This will give
  the inscribed circle within the triangle.</p>

  <h3>Points to Consider</h3>

  <p>How are circles related to triangles, and how are triangles
  related to circles? If we draw a circle first, what are the
  possibilities for the triangles we can circumscribe? In later
  chapters we will more carefully define and work with the
  properties of circles.</p>

    the angle bisector method.

      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>Consider equilateral triangle <img src=
    "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Ctriangle%20ABC"
      alt="\triangle ABC">. Construct the angle bisectors of the
      triangle and the incenter <img src=
      "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=X" alt="X">.
      Connect the incenter to each vertex so that the line segment
      intersects the side opposite the angle as follows.

      "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=776" width=
      "256px"></div>

      <p>As with circumcenters, we get six congruent <img src=
      "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=30%5E%5Ccirc-60%5E%5Ccirc-90%5E%5Ccirc"
      alt="30^\circ-60^\circ-90^\circ"> triangles. Now connect the
      points that intersect the sides. What kind of figure do you
      get?</p>
    </li>

    <li>True or false: An incenter can also be a circumcenter.
    Illustrate your reasoning with a drawing.</li>

    <li>Consider the situation described in exercise 4 for the case
    of an isosceles triangle. What can you conclude about the six
    triangles that are formed?

    </li>

    <li>Consider line segment <img src=
    "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Coverline%7BAB%7D"
    alt="\overline{AB}"> with coordinates <img src=
    "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=A%284%2C4%29"
    alt="A(4,4)">, <img src=
    "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=B%288%2C4%29"
    alt="B(8,4)">. Suppose that we wish to find points <img src=
    "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=C" alt="C">
    and <img src=
    "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=D" alt="D"> so
    that the resulting quadrilateral can be either circumscribed or
    inscribed. What are some possibilities for locating points
    <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=C"
    alt="C"> and <img src=
    "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=D%3F" alt=
    "D?"></li>

    <li>Using a piece of tracing or Patty Paper, construct an
    equilateral triangle. Bisect one angle by folding one side onto
    another. Unfold the paper. What can you conclude about the fold
    line?</li>

    <li>Repeat exercise 8 with an isosceles triangle. What can you
    conclude about repeating the folds?</li>

    <li>What are some other kinds of polygons where you could use
    Patty Paper to bisect an angle into congruent figures?</li>

    <li>The statement is true in the case of an equilateral
    triangle. In addition, for squares the statement is also true.

    <li>We do not get six congruent triangles as before. But we get
    four congruent triangles and a separate pair of congruent
    triangles. In addition, if we connect the points where the
    bisectors intersect the sides, we get an isosceles triangle.

    <li>From our previous exercises we saw that we could inscribe
    and circumscribe some but not all types of quadrilaterals.
    Drawing from those exercises, we see that we could circumscribe
    and inscribe a square. So, locating the points at <img src=
    "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=C%284%2C%208%29"
    alt="C(4, 8)"> and <img src=
    "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=D%288%2C%208%29"
    alt="D(8, 8)"> is one such possibility. Similarly, we could
    locate the points at <img src="http://pi"></li>
