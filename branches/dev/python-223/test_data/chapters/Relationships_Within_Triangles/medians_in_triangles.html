<h2>Medians in Triangles</h2><h3>Learning Objectives</h3><ul><li>Construct the medians of a triangle. </li><li>Apply the Concurrency of Medians Theorem to identify the point of concurrency of the medians of the triangle (the centroid). </li><li>Use the Concurrency of Medians Theorem to solve problems involving the centroid of triangles. </li></ul><h3>Introduction</h3><p>In our two last lessons we learned to circumscribe circles about triangles by finding the perpendicular bisectors of the sides and to inscribe circles within triangles by finding the triangle&rsquo;s angle bisectors. In this lesson we will learn how to find the location of a point within the triangle that involves the medians.</p><h3>Definition of Median of a Triangle</h3><p>A <strong role="strong">median</strong> of a triangle is the line segment that joins a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.</p><p>Here is an example that shows the medians in an obtuse triangle.</p><p><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=773" width="256px" /></div></p><p>That the three medians appear to intersect in a point is no coincidence. As was true with perpendicular bisectors of the triangle sides and with angle bisectors, the three medians will be concurrent (intersect in a point). We call this point the <strong role="strong">centroid</strong> of the triangle. We can prove the following theorem about centroids.</p><h3>The Centroid of a Triangle</h3><p><strong role="strong">Concurrency of Medians Theorem:</strong> The medians of a triangle will intersect in a point that is two-thirds of the distance from the vertices to the midpoint of the opposite side.</p><p>Consider <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Ctriangle%20ABC" alt="\triangle ABC" /> with midpoints of the sides located at <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=R" alt="R" />, <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=S" alt="S" />, and <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=T" alt="T" /> and the point of concurrency of the medians at the centroid, <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=X" alt="X" />.

We will explore Napoleon&rsquo;s theorem using The Geometer&rsquo;s Sketchpad.</p><p>But first we need to review how to construct an equilateral triangle using circles. Consider <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Coverline%7BXY%7D" alt="\overline{XY}" /> and circles having equal radius and centered at <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=X" alt="X" /> and <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=Y" alt="Y" /> as follows:</p><p><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=799" width="256px" /></div></p><p>Once you have hidden the circles, you will have an equilateral triangle. You can use the construction any time you need to construct an equilateral triangle by selecting the finished triangle and then making a Tool using the tool menu.</p><p><strong role="strong">Preliminary construction for Napoleon&rsquo;s Theorem:</strong> Construct any triangle <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Ctriangle%20ABC" alt="\triangle ABC" />. Construct an equilateral triangle on each side.</p><p><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=689" width="256px" /></div></p><p>Find the centroid of each equilateral triangle and connect the centroids to get the Napoleon outer triangle.</p><p><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=786" width="256px" /></div></p><p>Measure the sides of the new triangle using Sketchpad. What can you conclude about the Napoleon outer triangle? (Answer: The triangle is equilateral.)</p><p><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=750" width="256px" /></div></p><p>This result is all the more remarkable since it applies to any triangle <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Ctriangle%20ABC" alt="\triangle ABC" />. You can verify this fact in GSP by "dragging" a vertex of the original triangle <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Ctriangle%20ABC" alt="\triangle ABC" /> to form other triangles. The outer triangle will remain equilateral. Homework problem 9 will allow you to further explore this theorem.</p><p><strong role="strong">Example 2</strong></p><p><em>Try this:</em></p><ol start><li>Draw a triangle on a sheet of card stock paper (or thin cardboard) and locate the centroid. </li><li>Carefully cut out the triangle. </li><li>Hold your pencil point up and place the triangle on it so that the centroid rests on the pencil. </li><li>What do you notice? </li></ol><p>The triangle balances on the pencil. Why does the triangle balance?</p><h3>Lesson Summary</h3><p>In this lesson we:</p><ul><li>Defined the centroid of a triangle. </li><li>Stated and proved the Concurrency of Medians Theorem. </li><li>Solved problems using the Concurrency of Medians Theorem. </li><li>Demonstrated Napoleon&rsquo;s Theorem. </li></ul><p> </p><h3>Points to Consider</h3><p>So far we have been looking at relationships within triangles. In later chapters we will review the area of a triangle. When we draw the medians of the triangle, six smaller triangles are created. Think about the area of these triangles, and how that might relate to example 1 above.</p><h3>Review Questions</h3><ol start><li>Find the centroid of <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Ctriangle%20ABC" alt="\triangle ABC" /> for each of the following triangles using Geometer's Sketchpad.
