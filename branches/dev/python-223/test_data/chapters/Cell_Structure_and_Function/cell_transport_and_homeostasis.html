  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>Probably the most important feature of a cell&rsquo;s
  phospholipid membranes is that they are selectively permeable. A
  membrane that is <strong role="strong">selectively
  permeable</strong> has control over what molecules or ions can
  enter or leave the cell, as shown in <strong role=
  "strong">Figure</strong> 1.27 <a href="#Bio33-01a-fig" id=
  "Bio33-01a-text" name="Bio33-01a-text">below</a>. The
  permeability of a membrane is dependent on the organization and
  characteristics of the membrane lipids and proteins. In this way,
  cell membranes help maintain a state of homeostasis within cells
  (and tissues, organs, and organ systems) so that an organism can
  stay alive and healthy.</p>

    <h3>Transport Across Membranes</h3>

    <p>The molecular make-up of the phospholipid bilayer limits the
    types of molecules that can pass through it. For example,
    hydrophobic (water-hating) molecules, such as carbon dioxide
    (CO<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), can easily pass
    through the lipid bilayer, but ions such as calcium
    (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and polar molecules such as water
    (H<sub>2</sub>O) cannot. The hydrophobic interior of the
    phospholipid does not allow ions or polar molecules through
    because they are hydrophilic, or water loving. In addition,
    large molecules such as sugars and proteins are too big to pass
    through the bilayer. Transport proteins within the membrane
    allow these molecules to cross the membrane into or out of the
    cell. This way, polar molecules avoid contact with the nonpolar
    interior of the membrane, and large molecules are moved through
    large pores.</p>

    <p>Every cell is contained within a membrane punctuated with
    transport proteins that act as channels or pumps to let in or
    force out certain molecules. The purpose of the transport
    proteins is to protect the cell's internal environment and to
    keep its balance of salts, nutrients, and proteins within a
    range that keeps the cell and the organism alive.</p>

    <p>There are three main ways that molecules can pass through a
    phospholipid membrane. The first way requires no energy input
    by the cell and is called passive transport. The second way
    requires that the cell uses energy to pull in or pump out
    certain molecules and ions and is called active transport. The
    third way is through vesicle transport, in which large
    molecules are moved across the membrane in bubble-like sacks
    that are made from pieces of the membrane.</p>

    <h3>Passive Transport</h3>

    <p><strong role="strong">Passive transport</strong> is a way
    that small molecules or ions move across the cell membrane
    without input of energy by the cell. The three main kinds of
    passive transport are diffusion, osmosis, and facilitated
    diffusion.</p>

    <h4>Diffusion</h4>

    <p><strong role="strong">Diffusion</strong> is the movement of
    molecules from an area of high concentration of the molecules
    to an area with a lower concentration. The difference in the
    concentrations of the molecules in the two areas is called the
    <strong role="strong">concentration gradient</strong>.
    Diffusion will continue until this gradient has been
    eliminated. Since diffusion moves materials from an area of
    higher concentration to the lower, it is described as moving
    solutes "down the concentration gradient." The end result of
    diffusion is an equal concentration, or <strong role=
    "strong">equilibrium</strong>, of molecules on both sides of
    the membrane.</p>

    <p>If a molecule can pass freely through a cell membrane, it
    will cross the membrane by diffusion (<strong role=
    "strong">Figure</strong> 1.28 <a href="#Bio3-3-n1-fig" id=

    <h4>Osmosis</h4>

    <p>Imagine you have a cup that has 100ml water, and you add 15g
    of table sugar to the water. The sugar dissolves and the
    mixture that is now in the cup is made up of a solute (the
    sugar), that is dissolved in the solvent (the water). The
    mixture of a solute in a solvent is called a solution.</p>

    <p>Imagine now that you have a second cup with 100ml of water,
    and you add 45 grams of table sugar to the water. Just like the
    first cup, the sugar is the solute, and the water is the
    solvent. But now you have two mixtures of different solute
    concentrations. In comparing two solutions of unequal solute
    concentration, the solution with the higher solute
    concentration is <strong role="strong">hypertonic</strong>, and
    the solution with the lower concentration is <strong role=
    "strong">hypotonic</strong>. Solutions of equal solute
    concentration are <strong role="strong">isotonic</strong>. The
    first sugar solution is hypotonic to the second solution. The
    second sugar solution is hypertonic to the first.</p>

    <p>You now add the two solutions to a beaker that has been
    divided by a selectively permeable membrane. The pores in the
    membrane are too small for the sugar molecules to pass through,
    but are big enough for the water molecules to pass through. The
    hypertonic solution is on one side of the membrane and the
    hypotonic solution on the other. The hypertonic solution has a
    lower water concentration than the hypotonic solution, so a
    concentration gradient of water now exists across the membrane.
    Water molecules will move from the side of higher water
    concentration to the side of lower concentration until both
    solutions are isotonic.</p>

    <p><strong role="strong">Osmosis</strong> is the diffusion of
    water molecules across a selectively permeable membrane from an
    area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.
    Water moves into and out of cells by osmosis. If a cell is in a
    hypertonic solution, the solution has a lower water
    concentration than the cell cytosol does, and water moves out
    of the cell until both solutions are isotonic. Cells placed in
    a hypotonic solution will take in water across their membrane
    until both the external solution and the cytosol are
    isotonic.</p>

    <p>A cell that does not have a rigid cell wall (such as a red
    blood cell), will swell and lyse (burst) when placed in a
    hypotonic solution. Cells with a cell wall will swell when
    placed in a hypotonic solution, but once the cell is turgid
    (firm), the tough cell wall prevents any more water from
    entering the cell. When placed in a hypertonic solution, a cell
    without a cell wall will lose water to the environment,
    shrivel, and probably die. In a hypertonic solution, a cell
    with a cell wall will lose water too. The plasma membrane pulls
    away from the cell wall as it shrivels. The cell becomes
    plasmolyzed. Animal cells tend to do best in an isotonic
    environment, plant cells tend to do best in a hypotonic
    environment. This is demonstrated in <strong role=
    "strong">Figure</strong> 1.29 <a href="#Bio03-03-03-fig" id=

    <p>When water moves into a cell by osmosis, osmotic pressure
    may build up inside the cell. If a cell has a cell wall, the
    wall helps maintain the cell&rsquo;s water balance. Osmotic
    pressure is the main cause of support in many plants. When a
    plant cell is in a hypotonic environment, the osmotic entry of
    water raises the turgor pressure exerted against the cell wall
    until the pressure prevents more water from coming into the
    cell. At this point the plant cell is turgid. The effects of
    osmotic pressures on plant cells are shown in <strong role=
    "strong">Figure</strong> 1.30 <a href="#Bio03-03-04-fig" id=
    "Bio03-03-04-text" name="Bio03-03-04-text">below</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>Figure</strong> 1.30</p>
    </div>

    <p>Osmosis can be seen very effectively when potato slices are
    added to a high concentration of salt solution (hypertonic).
    The water from inside the potato moves out of the potato cells
    to the salt solution, which causes the potato cells to lose
    turgor pressure. The more concentrated the salt solution, the
    greater the difference in the size and weight of the potato
    slice after plasmolysis.</p>

    <p>The action of osmosis can be very harmful to organisms,
    especially ones without cell walls. For example, if a saltwater
    fish (whose cells are isotonic with seawater), is placed in
    fresh water, its cells will take on excess water, lyse, and the
    fish will die. Another example of a harmful osmotic effect is
    the use of table salt to kill slugs and snails.</p>

    <h4>Controlling Osmosis</h4>

    <p>Organisms that live in a hypotonic environment such as
    freshwater, need a way to prevent their cells from taking in
    too much water by osmosis. A <strong role="strong">contractile
    vacuole</strong> is a type of vacuole that removes excess water
    from a cell. Freshwater protists, such as the paramecia shown
    in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong> 1.31 <a href=
    "#Bio33-05b-fig" id="Bio33-05b-text" name=
    "Bio33-05b-text">below</a>, have a contractile vacuole. The
    vacuole is surrounded by several canals, which absorb water by
    osmosis from the cytoplasm. After the canals fill with water,
    the water is pumped into the vacuole. When the vacuole is full,
    it pushes the water out of the cell through a pore. Other
    protists, such as members of the genus <em>Amoeba</em>, have
    contractile vacuoles that move to the surface of the cell when
    full and release the water into the environment.</p>

    <h4>Facilitated Diffusion</h4>

    <p><strong role="strong">Facilitated diffusion</strong> is the
    diffusion of solutes through transport proteins in the plasma
    membrane. Facilitated diffusion is a type of passive transport.
    Even though facilitated diffusion involves transport proteins,
    it is still passive transport because the solute is moving down
    the concentration gradient.</p>

    <p>As was mentioned earlier, small nonpolar molecules can
    easily diffuse across the cell membrane. However, due to the
    hydrophobic nature of the lipids that make up cell membranes,
    polar molecules (such as water) and ions cannot do so. Instead,
    they diffuse across the membrane through transport proteins. A
    <strong role="strong">transport protein</strong> completely
    spans the membrane, and allows certain molecules or ions to
    diffuse across the membrane. Channel proteins, gated channel
    proteins, and carrier proteins are three types of transport
    proteins that are involved in facilitated diffusion.</p>

    <p>A <strong role="strong">channel protein</strong>, a type of
    transport protein, acts like a pore in the membrane that lets
    water molecules or small ions through quickly. Water channel
    proteins allow water to diffuse across the membrane at a very
    fast rate. Ion channel proteins allow ions to diffuse across
    the membrane.</p>

    <p>A <strong role="strong">gated channel protein</strong> is a
    transport protein that opens a "gate," allowing a molecule to
    pass through the membrane. Gated channels have a binding site
    that is specific for a given molecule or ion. A stimulus causes
    the "gate" to open or shut. The stimulus may be chemical or
    electrical signals, temperature, or mechanical force, depending
    on the type of gated channel. For example, the sodium gated
    channels of a nerve cell are stimulated by a chemical signal
    which causes them to open and allow sodium ions into the cell.
    Glucose molecules are too big to diffuse through the plasma
    membrane easily, so they are moved across the membrane through
    gated channels. In this way glucose diffuses very quickly
    across a cell membrane, which is important because many cells
    depend on glucose for energy.</p>

    <p>A <strong role="strong">carrier protein</strong> is a
    transport protein that is specific for an ion, molecule, or
    group of substances. Carrier proteins "carry" the ion or
    molecule across the membrane by changing shape after the
    binding of the ion or molecule. Carrier proteins are involved
    in passive and active transport. A model of a channel protein
    and carrier proteins is shown in <strong role=
    "strong">Figure</strong> 1.32 <a href="#Bio03-03-06-fig" id=
    "Bio03-03-06-text" name="Bio03-03-06-text">below</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>Figure</strong> 1.32</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Ion Channels</h4>

    <p>Ions such as sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>), potassium
    (K<sup>-</sup>), calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>), and chloride
    (Cl<sup>-</sup>), are important for many cell functions.
    Because they are polar, these ions do not diffuse through the
    membrane. Instead they move through ion channel proteins where
    they are protected from the hydrophobic interior of the
    membrane. <strong role="strong">Ion channels</strong> allow the
    formation of a concentration gradient between the extracellular
    fluid and the cytosol. Ion channels are very specific as they
    allow only certain ions through the cell membrane. Some ion
    channels are always open, others are "gated" and can be opened
    or closed. Gated ion channels can open or close in response to
    different types of stimuli such as electrical or chemical
    signals.</p>

    <h3>Active Transport</h3>

    <p>In contrast to facilitated diffusion which does not require
    energy and carries molecules or ions down a concentration
    gradient, active transport pumps molecules and ions against a
    concentration gradient. Sometimes an organism needs to
    transport something against a concentration gradient. The only
    way this can be done is through active transport which uses
    energy that is produced by respiration (ATP). In active
    transport, the particles move across a cell membrane from a
    lower concentration to a higher concentration. <strong role=
    "strong">Active transport</strong> is the energy-requiring
    process of pumping molecules and ions across membranes "uphill"
    against a gradient.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The active transport of small molecules or ions across a
      cell membrane is generally carried out by transport proteins
      that are found in the membrane.</li>

      <li>Larger molecules such as starch can also be actively
      transported across the cell membrane by processes called
      endocytosis and exocytosis (discussed later).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Sodium-Potassium Pump</h4>

    <p>Carrier proteins can work with a concentration gradient
    (passive transport), but some carrier proteins can move solutes
    against the concentration gradient (from high concentration to
    low), with energy input from ATP. As in other types of cellular
    activities, ATP supplies the energy for most active transport.
    One way ATP powers active transport is by transferring a
    phosphate group directly to a carrier protein. This may cause
    the carrier protein to change its shape, which moves the
    molecule or ion to the other side of the membrane. An example
    of this type of active transport system, as shown in
    <strong role="strong">Figure</strong> 1.33 <a href=
    "#Bio-03-03-07-fig" id="Bio-03-03-07-text" name=
    "Bio-03-03-07-text">below</a>, is the <strong role=
    "strong">sodium-potassium pump,</strong> which exchanges sodium
    ions for potassium ions across the plasma membrane of animal
    cells.</p>

    <div style=
    "float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class=

      <p><strong>Figure</strong> 1.33</p>
    </div>

    <p>As is shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong> 1.33
    <a href="#Bio-03-03-07-fig" id="Bio-03-03-07-text" name=
    "Bio-03-03-07-text">above</a>, three sodium ions bind with the
    protein pump inside the cell. The carrier protein then gets
    energy from ATP and changes shape. In doing so, it pumps the
    three sodium ions out of the cell. At that point, two potassium
    ions move in from outside the cell and bind to the protein
    pump. The sodium-potassium pump is found in the plasma membrane
    of almost every human cell and is common to all cellular life.
    It helps maintain cell potential and regulates cellular volume.
    Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that results in a
    misshapen chloride ion pump. Chloride levels within the cells
    are not controlled properly, and the cells produce thick mucus.
    The chloride ion pump is important for creating sweat,
    digestive juices, and mucus.</p>

    <h4>The Electrochemical Gradient</h4>

    <p>The active transport of ions across the membrane causes an
    electrical gradient to build up across the plasma membrane. The
    number of positively charged ions outside the cell is greater
    than the number of positively charged ions in the cytosol. This
    results in a relatively negative charge on the inside of the
    membrane, and a positive charge on the outside. This difference
    in charges causes a voltage across the membrane. Voltage is
    electrical potential energy that is caused by a separation of
    opposite charges, in this case across the membrane. The voltage
    across a membrane is called membrane potential. Membrane
    potential is very important for the conduction of electrical
    impulses along nerve cells.</p>

    <p>Because the inside of the cell is negative compared to
    outside the cell, the membrane potential favors the movement of
    positively charged ions (cations) into the cell, and the
    movement of negative ions (anions) out of the cell. So, there
    are two forces that drive the diffusion of ions across the
    plasma membrane&mdash;a chemical force (the ions' concentration
    gradient), and an electrical force (the effect of the membrane
    potential on the ions&rsquo; movement). These two forces
    working together are called an electrochemical gradient, and
    will be discussed in detail in the chapter Nervous and
    Endocrine Systems.</p>

    <h3>Vesicles and Active Transport</h3>

    <p>Some molecules or particles are just too large to pass
    through the plasma membrane or to move through a transport
    protein. So cells use two other methods to move these
    macromolecules (large molecules) into or out of the cell.
    Vesicles or other bodies in the cytoplasm move macromolecules
    or large particles across the plasma membrane. There are two
    types of vesicle transport, endocytosis and exocytosis.</p>

    <h4>Endocytosis and Exocytosis</h4>

    <p><strong role="strong">Endocytosis</strong> is the process of
    capturing a substance or particle from outside the cell by
    engulfing it with the cell membrane. The membrane folds over
    the substance and it becomes completely enclosed by the
    membrane. At this point a membrane-bound sac, or vesicle
    pinches off and moves the substance into the cytosol. There are
    two main kinds of endocytosis:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong role="strong">Phagocytosis</strong> or "cellular
      eating," occurs when the dissolved materials enter the cell.
      The plasma membrane engulfs the solid material, forming a
      phagocytic vesicle.</li>

      <li><strong role="strong">Pinocytosis</strong> or "cellular
      drinking," occurs when the plasma membrane folds inward to
      form a channel allowing dissolved substances to enter the
      cell, as shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong> 1.34
      <a href="#Bio33-08a-fig" id="Bio33-08a-text" name=
      "Bio33-08a-text">below</a>. When the channel is closed, the
      liquid is encircled within a pinocytic vesicle.</li>

    <p><strong role="strong">Exocytosis</strong> describes the
    process of vesicles fusing with the plasma membrane and
    releasing their contents to the outside of the cell, as shown
    in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong> 1.35 <a href=
    "#Bio3-3-n9-fig" id="Bio3-3-n9-text" name=
    "Bio3-3-n9-text">above</a>. Exocytosis occurs when a cell
    produces substances for export, such as a protein, or when the
    cell is getting rid of a waste product or a toxin. Newly made
    membrane proteins and membrane lipids are moved on top the
    plasma membrane by exocytosis. For a detailed animation on
    cellular secretion, see <a href=

    <h4>Homeostasis and Cell Function</h4>

    <p><strong role="strong">Homeostasis</strong> refers to the
    balance, or equilibrium within the cell or a body. It is an
    organism&rsquo;s ability to keep a constant internal
    environment. Keeping a stable internal environment requires
    constant adjustments as conditions change inside and outside
    the cell. The adjusting of systems within a cell is called
    homeostatic regulation. Because the internal and external
    environments of a cell are constantly changing, adjustments
    must be made continuously to stay at or near the set point (the
    normal level or range). Homeostasis is a dynamic equilibrium
    rather than an unchanging state. The cellular processes
    discussed in this lesson all play an important role in
    homeostatic regulation. You will learn more about homeostasis
    in <em>The Human Body</em> chapter.</p>

    <h3>Cell Communication</h3>

    <p>To survive and grow, cells need to be able to "talk" with
    their cell neighbors and be able to detect change in their
    environment. Talking with neighbors is even more important to a
    cell if it is part of a multicellular organism. The billions of
    cells that make up your body need to be able to communicate
    with each other to allow your body to grow, and to keep you
    alive and healthy. The same is true for any organism. Cell
    signaling is a major area of research in biology today.
    Recently scientists have discovered that many different cell
    types, from bacteria to plants, use similar types of
    communication pathways, or cell-signaling mechanisms. This
    suggests that cell-signaling mechanisms evolved long before the
    first multicellular organism did.</p>

    <h4>The Language of Cells</h4>

    <p>For cells to be able to signal to each other, a few things
    are needed:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>a signal</li>

      <li>a cell receptor, which is usually on the plasma membrane,
      but can be found inside the cell</li>

      <li>a response to the signal</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Cells that are communicating may be right next to each other
    or far apart. The type of chemical signal a cell will send
    differs depending on the distance the message needs to go. For
    example, hormones, ions, and neurotransmitters are all types of
    signals that are sent depending on the distance the message
    needs to go.</p>

    <p>The target cell then needs to be able to recognize the
    signal. Chemical signals are received by the target cell on
    receptor proteins. As discussed earlier, most receptor proteins
    are found in the plasma membrane. Most receptors proteins are
    found on the plasma membrane, but some are also found inside
    the cell. These receptor proteins are very specific for only
    one particular signal molecule, much like a lock that
    recognizes only one key. Therefore, a cell has lots of receptor
    proteins to recognize the large number of cell signal
    molecules. There are three stages to sending and receiving a
    cell "message:" reception, transduction, and response.</p>

    <h4>Signal Receptors</h4>

    <p>Cell-surface receptors are integral proteins&mdash;they
    reach right through the lipid bilayer, spanning from the
    outside to the inside of the cell. These receptor proteins are
    specific for just one kind of signal molecule. The signaling
    molecule acts as a ligand when it binds to a receptor protein.
    A <strong role="strong">ligand</strong> is a small molecule
    that binds to a larger molecule. Signal molecule binding causes
    the receptor protein to change its shape. At this point the
    receptor protein can interact with another molecule. The ligand
    (signal molecule) itself does not pass through the plasma
    membrane.</p>

    <p>In eukaryotic cells, most of the intracellular proteins that
    are activated by a ligand binding to a receptor protein are
    enzymes. Receptor proteins are named after the type of enzyme
    that they interact with inside the cell. These enzymes include
    G proteins and protein kinases, likewise there are
    G-protein-linked receptors and tyrosine kinase receptors. A
    kinase is a protein involved in phosphorylation. A
    <strong role="strong">G-protein linked receptor</strong> is a
    receptor that works with the help of a protein called a
    G-protein. A G-protein gets its name from the molecule to which
    it is attached, guanosine triphosphate (GTP), or guanosine
    diphosphate (GDP). The GTP molecule is similar to ATP.</p>

    <p>Once G proteins or protein kinase enzymes are activated by a
    receptor protein, they create molecules called second
    messengers. A <strong role="strong">second messenger</strong>
    is a small molecule that starts a change inside a cell in
    response to the binding of a specific signal to a receptor
    protein. Some second messenger molecules include small
    molecules called cyclic nucleotides, such as cyclic adenosine
    monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).
    Calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) also act as secondary
    messengers. Secondary messengers are a part of signal
    transduction pathways.</p>

    <h4>Signal Transduction</h4>

    <p>A <strong role="strong">signal-transduction pathway</strong>
    is the signaling mechanism by which a cell changes a signal on
    it surface into a specific response inside the cell. It most
    often involves an ordered sequence of chemical reactions inside
    the cell which is carried out by enzymes and other molecules.
    In many signal transduction processes, the number of proteins
    and other molecules participating in these events increases as
    the process progresses from the binding of the signal. A
    "signal cascade" begins. Think of a signal cascade as a
    chemical domino-effect inside the cell, in which one domino
    knocks over two dominos, which in turn knock over four dominos,
    and so on. The advantage of this type of signaling to the cell
    is that the message from one little signal molecule can be
    greatly amplified and have a dramatic effect.</p>

    <p>G protein-linked receptors are only found in higher
    eukaryotes, including yeast, plants, and animals. Your senses
    of sight and smell are dependent on G-protein linked receptors.
    The ligands that bind to these receptors include
    light-sensitive compounds, odors, hormones, and
    neurotransmitters. The ligands for G-protein linked receptors
    come in different sizes, from small molecules to large
    proteins. G protein-coupled receptors are involved in many
    diseases, but are also the target of around half of all modern
    medicinal drugs.</p>

    <p>The process of how a G-protein linked receptor works is
    outlined in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong> 1.36 <a href=

            of this signal transduction is cAMP, as shown in

    <p>The sensing of the external and internal environments at the
    cellular level relies on signal transduction. Defects in signal
    transduction pathways can contribute or lead to many diseases,
    including cancer and heart disease. This highlights the
    importance of signal transductions to biology and medicine.</p>

    <h4>Signal Responses</h4>

    <p>In response to a signal, a cell may change activities in the
    cytoplasm or in the nucleus that include the switching on or
    off of genes. Changes in metabolism, continued growth,
    movement, or death are some of the cellular responses to
    signals that require signal transduction.</p>

    <p>Gene activation leads to other effects, since the protein
    products of many of the responding genes include enzymes and
    factors that increase gene expression. Gene expression factors
    produced as a result of a cascade can turn on even more genes.
    Therefore one stimulus can trigger the expression of many
    genes, and this in turn can lead to the activation of many
    complex events. In a multicellular organism these events
    include the increased uptake of glucose from the blood stream
    (stimulated by insulin), and the movement of neutrophils to
    sites of infection (stimulated by bacterial products). The set
    of genes and the order in which they are activated in response
    to stimuli are often called a genetic program.</p>

    <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Molecules and ions cross the plasma membrane either by
      passive transport or active the transport.</li>

      <li>Passive transport is the movement of molecules across the
      cell membrane without an input of energy from the cell.</li>

      <li>Diffusion is the movement of molecules or ions from an
      area of high concentration to an area of lower concentration.
      The molecules keep moving down the concentration gradient
      until equilibrium is reached.</li>

      <li>Osmosis is the diffusion of water molecules across a
      semipermeable membrane and down a concentration gradient.
      They can move into or out of a cell, depending on the
      concentration of the solute.</li>

      <li>Active transport moves molecules across a cell membrane
      from an area of lower concentration to an area of higher
      concentration. Active transport requires the use of
      energy.</li>

      <li>The active transport of small molecules or ions across a
      cell membrane is generally carried out by transport proteins
      that are found in the membrane.</li>

      <li>The sodium-potassium pump is an example of a cell
      membrane pump. It moves three sodium ions out of the cell and
      two potassium ions into the cell. The sodium-potassium pump
      uses ATP.</li>

      <li>Endocytosis and exocytosis are active transport
      mechanisms in which large molecules enter and leave the cell
      inside vesicles.</li>

      <li>In endocytosis, a substance or particle from outside the
      cell is engulfed by the cell membrane. The membrane folds
      over the substance and it becomes completely enclosed by the
      membrane. There are two main kinds of endocytosis:
      pinocytosis and phagocytosis.</li>

      <li>Communication between cells is important for coordinating
      cell function in an organism. Membrane proteins and vesicles
      are involved in cellular communication.</li>
    </ul>

        Unless an animal cell (such as the red blood cell in the

        osmotic uptake of water, it will lose too much water and
        shrivel up in a hypertonic environment. If placed in a
        hypotonic solution, water molecules will enter the cell
        causing it to swell and burst. Plant cells (bottom panel)
        become plasmolyzed in a hypertonic solution, but tend to do
        best in a hypotonic environment. Water is stored in the
