  <p><strong role="strong">PART II: Reflection, Refraction, Mirrors
  and Lenses</strong></p>

  <p><strong role="strong">The Big Idea</strong></p>

  <p>Fermat&rsquo;s Principle states that <em>light will always
  take the path of least amount of time</em> (not distance). This
  principle governs the paths light will take and explains the
  familiar phenomena of reflection, refraction, lenses and
  diffraction. Light rarely travels in a straight-line path. When
  photons interact with electrons in matter the time it takes for
  this interaction determines the path. For example, higher
  frequency blue light is refracted more than red because blue
  wavelengths interacts more frequently with electrons than red
  wavelengths and the path of least time is for blue to bend more
  then red in order to get out of this &lsquo;slow&rsquo; area
  faster. The rainbows we see are a result of this. Fermat&rsquo;s
  Principle explains the many fascinating phenomena of light from
  rainbows to sunsets to the haloes around the moon.</p>

  <p><strong role="strong">Key Concepts</strong></p>

  <div><img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=7573" width=
  "256px"></div>

  <ul>
    <li>Fermat&rsquo;s Principle makes the angle of incident light
    equal to the angle of reflected light. This is the <em>law of
    reflection</em>.</li>

    <li>When light travels from one type of material (like air)
    into another (like glass), the speed slows down due to
    interactions between photons and electrons. If the ray enters
    the material at an angle Fermat&rsquo;s Principle dictates that
    the light also changes the direction of its motion. This is
    called <em>refraction</em>. See the figure shown to the right,
    which demonstrates the refraction a light ray experiences as it
    passes from air into a rectangular piece of glass and out
    again. Because light travels at slower than usual speed in
    transparent materials (due to constantly being absorbed and
    re-emitted), the light ray bends in order to get out of this
    material quicker and satisfy Fermat&rsquo;s Principle. Note
    that this means that light doesn&rsquo;t always travel in a
    straight line.</li>

    <li>When light is refracted its <em>wavelength</em> and
    <em>speed</em> change; however, its frequency remains the same
    as the frequency of the light source.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong role="strong">Key Applications</strong></p>

  <div><img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=7567" width=
  "256px"></div>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Total internal reflection</em> occurs when light goes
    from a slow (high index of refraction) medium to a fast (low
    index of refraction) medium. With total internal reflection,
    light refracts <em>so</em> much it actually refracts back into
    the first medium. This is how fiber optic cables work: no light
    leaves the wire.</li>

    <li><em>Lenses</em>, made from curved pieces of glass, focus or
    de-focus light as it passes through. Lenses that focus light
    are called <em>converging</em> lenses, and these are the ones
    used to make telescopes and cameras. Lenses that de-focus light
    are called <em>diverging</em> lenses.</li>

    <li>Lenses can be used to make visual representations, called
    <em>images</em>.</li>

    <li><em>Mirrors</em> are made from highly reflective metal that
    is applied to a curved or flat piece of glass. Converging
    mirrors can be used to focus light &ndash; headlights,
    telescopes, satellite TV receivers, and solar cookers all rely
    on this principle. Like lenses, mirrors can create images.</li>

    <li>The <em>focal length</em>,<img src=
    "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=f" alt="f">,
    of a lens or mirror is the distance from the surface of the
    lens or mirror to the place where the light is focused. This is
    called the <em>focal point</em> or <em>focus</em>. For
    diverging lenses or mirrors, the focal length is negative.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>When light rays converge in front of a mirror or behind a
    lens, a <em>real</em> image is formed. Real images are useful
    in that you can place photographic film at the physical
    location of the real image, expose the film to the light, and
    make a two-dimensional representation of the world, a
    photograph.</li>
  </ul>

  <div><img src=
  "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=7566" width=
  "256px"></div>

  <ul>
    <li>When light rays diverge in front of a mirror or behind a
    lens, a <em>virtual</em> image is formed. A virtual image is a
    trick, like the person you see &ldquo;behind&rdquo; a
    mirror&rsquo;s surface when you brush your teeth. Since virtual
    images aren&rsquo;t actually &ldquo;anywhere,&rdquo; you
    can&rsquo;t place photographic film anywhere to capture
    them.</li>

    <li>Real images are upside-down, or <em>inverted</em>. You can
    make a real image of an object by putting it farther from a
    mirror or lens than the focal length. Virtual images are
    typically right-side-up. You can make virtual images by moving
    the mirror or lens closer to the object than the focal
    length.</li>
  </ul>

    <li>The figure above is immersed in water. Draw the light ray
    as it enters the Gas medium through its exit back into the
    water medium at the bottom. Be very careful drawing your light
    rays, making sure that it is clear when (and by how much) the
    angle is increasing, when decreasing and when staying the same.
    You may want to calculate the refracted angles to check your
    light ray drawings.</li>

    <li>Here&rsquo;s an example of the &ldquo;flat mirror

    Assume that her eyes are <img src=

      alt="10\;\mathrm{cm}"> below the top of her head, and that

      alt="180\;\mathrm{cm}"> tall. Calculate the minimum length
      flat mirror that Marjan would need to see her body from eye
      level all the way down to her feet. Sketch at least <img src=
      "http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=3" alt="3">
      ray traces from her eyes showing the topmost, bottommost, and
      middle rays.

      <p><em>In the following five problems, you will do a careful
      ray tracing with a ruler (including the extrapolation of rays
      for virtual images). It is best if you can use different
      colors for the three different ray tracings. When sketching
      diverging rays, you should use dotted lines for the
      extrapolated lines behind a mirror or in front of a lens in
      order to produce the virtual image. When comparing measured
      distances and heights to calculated distances and heights,
      values within <img src=

    <li>A piece of transparent goo falls on your paper. You notice
    that the letters on your page appear smaller than they really
    are. Is the goo acting as a converging lens or a diverging
    lens? Explain. Is the image you see real or virtual?
    Explain.</li>

    <li>Little Red Riding Hood (<em>aka</em> R-Hood) gets to her
    grandmother&rsquo;s house only to find the Big Bad Wolf
    (<em>aka</em> BBW) in her place. R-Hood notices that BBW is
    wearing her grandmother&rsquo;s glasses and it makes the
    wolf&rsquo;s eyes look magnified (bigger).

      <p>a. Are these glasses for near-sighted or far-sighted
      people? For full credit, explain your answer thoroughly. You
      may need to consult some resources online.</p>

      <p>b. Create a diagram below of how these glasses correct a
      person&rsquo;s vision.</p>
    </li>

    <li>To the right is a diagram showing how to make a
    &ldquo;ghost light bulb.&rdquo; The real light bulb is below
    the box and it forms an image of the exact same size right
    above it. The image looks very real until you try to touch it.
    What is the focal length of the concave mirror?
