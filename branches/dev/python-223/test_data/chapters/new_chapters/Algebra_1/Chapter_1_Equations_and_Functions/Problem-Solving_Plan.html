<h2>Lesson 1.7:Problem-Solving Plan  </h2><h3>Learning Objectives  </h3><ul><li>Read and understand given problem situations.  </li><li>Make a plan to solve the problem. </li><li>Solve the problem and check the results.  </li><li>Compare alternative approaches to solving the problem.  </li><li>Solve real-world problems using a plan. </li></ul><h3>Introduction  </h3><p>We always think of mathematics as the subject in school where we solve lots of problems. Throughout your experience with mathematics you have solved many problems and you will certainly encounter many more. Problem solving is necessary in all aspects of life. Buying a house, renting a car, figuring out which is the better sale are just a few examples where people use problem solving techniques. In this book, you will use a systematic plan to solve real-world problem and learn different strategies and approaches to solving problems. In this section, we will introduce a problem-solving plan that will be useful throughout this book. </p><h3>Read and Understand a Given Problem Situation  </h3><p>The first step to solving a word problem is to <strong role="strong">read and understand</strong> the problem. Here are a few questions that you should be asking yourself. </p><dl><dt></dt><dd>What am I trying to find out?  </dd><dt></dt><dd>What information have I been given?  </dd><dt></dt><dd>Have I ever solved a similar problem? </dd></dl><p>This is also a good time to define any variables. When you identify your <strong role="strong">knowns</strong> and <strong role="strong">unknowns</strong>, it is often useful to assign them a letter to make notation and calculations easier.</p><h3>Make a Plan to Solve the Problem  </h3><p>The next step in the problem-solving plan is to <strong role="strong">make a plan</strong> or <strong role="strong">develop a strategy.</strong> How can the information you know assist you in figuring out the unknowns? </p><p>Here are some common strategies that you will learn.  </p><ul><li>Drawing a diagram. </li><li>Making a table.  </li><li>Looking for a pattern.  </li><li>Using guess and check. </li><li>Working backwards.  </li><li>Using a formula.  </li><li>Reading and making graphs.  </li><li>Writing equations.  </li><li>Using linear models.  </li><li>Using dimensional analysis.  </li><li>Using the right type of function for the situation. </li></ul><p>In most problems, you will use a combination of strategies. For example, drawing a diagram and looking for patterns are good strategies for most problems. Also, making a table and drawing a graph are often used together. The &#8220;writing an equation&#8221; strategy is the one you will work with the most in your study of algebra. </p><h3>Solve the Problem and Check the Results  </h3><p>Once you develop a plan, you can implement it and <strong role="strong">solve the problem.</strong> That means using tables, graph and carrying out all operations to arrive at the answer you are seeking. </p><p>The last step in solving any problem should always be to <strong role="strong">check and interpret</strong> the answer. Here are some questions to help you to do that.</p><p>Does the answer make sense?  </p><p>If you plug the solution back into the problem do all the numbers work out?  </p><p>Can you use another method to arrive at the same answer? </p><h3>Compare Alternative Approaches to Solving the Problem  </h3><p>Sometimes a certain problem is best solved by using a specific method. Most of the time, however, it can be solved by using several different strategies. When you are familiar with all of the problem-solving strategies, it is up to you to choose the methods that you are most comfortable with and that make sense to you. In this book, we will often use more than one method to solve a problem.  This way we can demonstrate the strengths and weakness of different strategies when applied to different types of problems.  </p><p>Regardless of the strategy you are using, you should always implement the problem-solving plan when you are solving word problems. Here is a summary of the problem-solving plan.  </p><p><strong role="strong">Step 1</strong></p><p>Understand the problem </p><p>Read the problem carefully. Once the problem is read, list all the components and data that are involved. This is where you will be assigning your variables. </p><p><strong role="strong">Step 2</strong></p><p>Devise a plan &#8211; Translate </p><p>Come up with a way to solve the problem. Set up an equation, draw a diagram, make a chart or construct a table as a start to solve your problem solving plan. </p><p><strong role="strong">Step 3</strong></p><p>Carry out the plan &#8211; Solve </p><p>This is where you solve the equation you developed in Step 2. </p><p><strong role="strong">Step 4</strong></p><p>Look &#8211; Check and Interpret </p><p>Check to see if you used all your information.  Then look to see if the answer makes sense. </p><h3>Solve Real-World Problems Using a Plan  </h3><p>Let&#8217;s now apply this problem solving plan to a problem.  </p><p><strong role="strong">Example 1</strong></p><p><em>A coffee maker is on sale at</em> <img src="http://xdt.ck12.org/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=50%5C%25" alt="50\%" /> <em>off the regular ticket price.
