But are resources useful for and valuable to humans &ndash; or all life? If we &ldquo;use&rdquo; them, do we necessarily &ldquo;consume&rdquo; them? Is value limited to economics? Are resources limited to materials, or can they include processes, systems, and living things?</p><p>Definitions of &ldquo;natural&rdquo; go straight to the heart of our views about ourselves. Most definitions include a tension or conflict between the human and the non-human parts of the Earth: Anything that is natural is &ldquo;not altered or disguised,&rdquo; &ldquo;not produced or changed artificially,&rdquo; or, rather unhelpfully, &ldquo;found in nature.&rdquo; We often define nature as separate from humans: &ldquo;the world of living things and the outdoors&rdquo; or with elements of inner conflict (&ldquo;a primitive state of existence, untouched and uninfluenced by civilization or artificiality&rdquo;) or even religion (&ldquo;humankind&rsquo;s natural state as distinguished from the state of grace&rdquo;).</p><p>It is not an idle exercise to think carefully about your own definition of natural resources, because such thinking can clarify your relationship and responsibilities to the Earth. Do natural resources exist only for humans to use (or &ldquo;exploit&rdquo; &ndash; a term repeated in many definitions)? Are we apart from nature, or a part of nature? In what ways are we similar to other species? How are we different? How do those similarities and differences help us to define our responsibilities to &ldquo;nature&rdquo; &ndash; to other species and our physical environment?</p><p>Historically, the concept of natural resources was intended as a measure of respect and appreciation for the materials Earth provided, and the supplies humans used and modified to develop the civilization in which they lived. Economic value was primary, and a list of natural resources would include energy sources such as coal or oil and raw materials such as iron or copper. Living things could be, but often were not added: fibers from plants, and skins from animals.</p><p>As use became exploitation and later depletion, we began to better appreciate our dependence on natural resources, as well as our power over them. Economist E.F. Schumacher, in a 1973 series of essays titled <em>Small is Beautiful,</em> suggested that our economy is unsustainable because natural resources (especially energy) can be depleted. He made the case that natural resources should be considered capital, rather than expendable &ndash; <em>conserved,</em> rather than simply <em>used.</em> He also argued that nature&rsquo;s capacity to resist pollution is limited, pointing to the value of whole ecosystems and ecosystem services. During the 1990s, ecological economist Robert Constanza calculated that &ldquo;nature&rsquo;s services&rdquo; were worth $33 trillion per year &ndash; more than the $25 trillion total of the inter-human economy at that time. Although awareness of resource depletion and ecosystem services is increasing, their values remain inadequately recognized by our economy, and sustainability remains a goal for the future.</p><p>What definition for natural resources shall we use? On the Department of Energy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ask a Scientist&rdquo; website, Bob Hartwell defines a natural resource as &ldquo;something supplied by nature which supports life on this planet.&rdquo; This concise description includes most of the ideas we&rsquo;ve discussed above, and views human use with an ecological perspective appropriate for the study of biology. Humankind is a part of nature, one species in an interdependent web which includes the Earth and all life. Without question, we are a unique species: we have the power to change that interdependent web in ways no other species can, we have the ability to learn about and understand the patterns and processes which maintain the web, and we have the responsibility to use our natural resources together with that understanding in ways which sustain the web &ndash; for our ourselves and for all life.</p><p>Most biologists today would probably classify ecosystems, their processes and &ldquo;services,&rdquo; and their species as natural resources, together with energy sources and materials from the environment. <strong role="strong">Biodiversity</strong> (which includes both species and ecosystems) is certainly a natural resource, according to this definition. In this sense, this entire chapter explores natural resources. The first lesson dealt with biodiversity as well as some of the ecosystem services which depend on biodiversity. This lesson will focus on energy, land and soil, and water resources. Because several unique problems (acid rain and <strong role="strong">ozone depletion</strong>, for example) apply to atmospheric resources, we will focus on the atmosphere in a third lesson. A final lesson will combine our concerns about the closely related issues of energy use and atmospheric change to focus on <strong role="strong">climate change</strong>. These lessons will by no means address all natural resources, but they should give you an overview of the complexities of and need for sustainable use, and provide you with some detailed insight into several major problems.</p><h3>Renewable and Nonrenewable Resources: Energy and Sustainable Use</h3><p>Applied to natural resources, <strong role="strong">renewable</strong> or <strong role="strong">non-renewable</strong> are relative rather than precise terms. Not surprisingly, we use human parameters to classify resources into these two categories.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2951" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio182-01a-text" id="Bio182-01a-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.22 <caption>Solar radiation and wind energy are considered renewable resources because their availability far exceeds our rates of consumption. Here, availability is shown as volume equal to the annual flux in terawatts (1 TW = 10 watts). Eighty-nine thousand TW represents the amount of sunlight that falls on the Earth's surface, 370 TW depicts all the energy in the wind, and 15 TW was the global rate of energy consumption in 2004.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>A resource replenished by natural processes at a rate roughly equal to the rate at which humans consume it is a <strong role="strong">renewable resource</strong>. Sunlight and wind, for example, are in no danger of being used in excess of their longterm availability (<strong role="strong">Figures</strong>  1.22 <a href="#Bio182-01a-fig" id="Bio182-01a-text">above</a>,  1.23 <a href="#Bio182-02-fig" id="Bio182-02-text">below</a>). Hydropower is renewed by the Earth&rsquo;s hydrologic cycle. Water has also been considered renewable, but overpumping of groundwater is depleting aquifers, and <strong role="strong">pollution</strong> threatens the use of many water resources, showing that the consequences of resource use are not always simple depletion. Soils are often considered renewable, but erosion and depletion of minerals proves otherwise. Living things (forests and fish, for example) are considered renewable because they can reproduce to replace individuals lost to human consumption. This is true only up to a point, however; overexploitation can lead to extinction, and overharvesting can remove nutrients so that soil fertility does not allow forest renewal. Energy resources derived from living things, such as ethanol, plant oils, and methane, are considered renewable, although their costs to the environment are not always adequately considered. Renewable materials would include sustainably harvested wood, cork, and bamboo as well as sustainably harvested crops. Metals and other minerals are sometimes considered renewable because they are not destroyed when they are used, and can be recycled.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2991" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio182-02-text" id="Bio182-02-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.23 <caption>Wind power is considered a renewable resource because the rate of supply far exceeds the rate of use ( ). Although current use supplies less than 1% of the worlds energy needs, growth in harvesting wind energy is rapid, with recent annual increases of more than 30 percent.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>A <strong role="strong">non-renewable resource</strong> is not regenerated or restored on a time scale comparative to its consumption. Non-renewable resources exist in fixed amounts (at least relative to our time frame), and can be used up. The classic examples are fossil fuels such as petroleum, coal, and natural gas. Fossil fuels have formed from remains of plants (for coal) and phyto- and zoo-plankton (for oil) over periods from 50 to 350 million years. Ecologist Jeff Dukes estimates that 20 metric tons of phytoplankton produce 1 liter of gasoline! We have been consuming fossil fuels for less than 200 years, yet even the most optimistic estimates suggest that remaining reserves can supply our needs for</p><dl><dt></dt><dd>Oil: 45 years </dd><dt></dt><dd>Gas: 72 years </dd><dt></dt><dd>Coal: 252 years. </dd></dl><p>Nuclear power is considered a non-renewable resource because uranium fuel supplies are finite. Some estimates suggest that known economically feasible supplies could last 70 years at current rates of use - although known, and probably unknown reserves are much larger, and new technologies could make some reserves more useful.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2996" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio18-02-03-text" id="Bio18-02-03-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.24 <caption>Global energy use includes mostly non-renewable (oil, coal, gas, and nuclear) but increasing amounts of renewable (biomass, hydro, solar, wind, geothermal, biofuels, and solar photovoltaic) resources.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>Recall that the Second Law of Thermodynamics (which states that the entropy of an isolated system which is not in equilibrium will tend to increase over time) reinforces this view of &ldquo;renewable&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-renewable&rdquo; resources: Energy flows downhill &ndash; gets used up, is transformed into heat; only materials that can be recycled are &ldquo;renewable.&rdquo; It is only our time scale which makes any form of energy renewable. Eventually, the sun will burn out, as well.</p><p>Population growth, industrialization of developing countries, and advances in technology are placing increasing pressures on our rates of consumption of natural resources. Pollution and overexploitation foreshadow resource depletion, habitat loss, and atmospheric change. Unequal distribution of wealth, technology, and energy use (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.25 <a href="#Bio182-04-fig" id="Bio182-04-text">below</a>) suggest that developing nations will further increase demands on natural resources. With these increases in demand, current levels of resource use cannot be maintained into the future, and social and political instability may increase. Improvements in technology could mitigate these problems to some extent.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2985" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio182-04-text" id="Bio182-04-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.25 <caption>Per capita energy consumption illustrates the unequal distribution of wealth and natural resource use which threatens long-term resource supplies as developing nations demand higher standards of living. These inequalities threaten not only resource supplies but also global political stability.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>The concept of renewable vs. non-renewable resources clearly depends on rates of human use (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.24 <a href="#Bio18-02-03-fig" id="Bio18-02-03-text">above</a>); less clearly, its usefulness depends on the effects of use on other natural resources, such as pollution. Of course, we could change our rates of consumption. Indeed, if we increase our rate of consumption, renewable resources may need to be reclassified as non-renewable. This is the foundation of the concept of <strong role="strong">sustainable use</strong> &ndash; use of resources at a rate which meets the needs of the present without impairing the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Notice that this concept continues to focus on human needs; however, a solid understanding of ecology recognizes that human needs depend on entire ecosystems, which in turn depend on all species. Sustainable use could also apply to ecosystem services, which can be overwhelmed by overuse even though their &ldquo;use&rdquo; does not involve consumption. Perhaps we should shift our natural resource focus from rate of consumption (renewable vs. non-renewable) to sustainable use!</p><h3>Soil and Land Resources</h3><p>What negative connotations we give to soil resources in our daily conversation! Hands are &ldquo;dirty;&rdquo; clothing is &ldquo;soiled.&rdquo; Yet the formation of soils require thousands and even millions of years of physical, geological, chemical, and biological processes. Soil&rsquo;s complex mixture of eroded rock, minerals, ions, partially decomposed organic material, water, air, roots, fungi, animals, and microorganisms supports the growth of plants, which are the foundation of terrestrial ecosystems (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.26 <a href="#Bio182-05-fig" id="Bio182-05-text">below</a>). Soil is a balanced intersection of air, water, and land resources, sensitive to changes in any one element. We use soils for agriculture, gardening, landscaping, earth sheltered buildings, and to absorb waste from composting and septic drain fields. Peat, an accumulation of partially decayed plant material, can be burned for energy.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2948" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio182-05-text" id="Bio182-05-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.26 <caption>Soil resources are a complex mixture of eroded rock, minerals, ions, partially decomposed organic material, water, air, roots, fungi, animals, and microorganisms, formed over thousands or even millions of years.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>Soils can assimilate and remove low levels of <strong role="strong">contamination</strong>, thus it is useful for waste treatment. Not surprisingly, high levels of contamination can kill soil microorganisms, which help to accomplish this service. Toxics from industry, underground storage tanks, pesticide use, and leaching from landfills and septic tanks contaminate soils across the globe. Contaminated soils endanger human and ecosystem health.</p><p>In 1980, after several years of health concerns and protests, the U.S. Government relocated and reimbursed 800 families from the Love Canal housing development built atop a landfill which had &ldquo;disposed of&rdquo; 22,000 tons of toxic waste from Hooker Chemical and Plastics Corporation. Increased awareness of the problems of abandoned toxic waste sites led to the passage later that year of <strong role="strong">Superfund</strong> legislation, which holds polluters accountable for effects of toxic waste, and taxes chemical and petroleum industries to pay for cleanup of sites where responsible parties cannot be identified. As of early 2007, the EPA listed 1,245 Superfund sites; 324 are delisted, and 66 new sites are proposed. In general, developing countries lag behind in identification, cleanup, and prevention.</p><p>Agriculture, as one of the largest land uses, has altered soils in a number of ways. When we harvest crops repeatedly from soil, we remove basic ions such as Calcium, Magnesium, Potassium, and Sodium. One result is <strong role="strong">acidification</strong>, which lowers soil fertility and productivity. <strong role="strong">Acid rain</strong> and the use of nitrogen fertilizers accelerate acidification, and acid rain can increase soil contamination.</p><p>Irrigation can degrade soils through <strong role="strong">salination</strong> &ndash; the accumulation of salts. High concentrations of salt make it difficult for plants to absorb water by osmosis, so salination reduces plant growth and productivity, and can lead to <strong role="strong">desertification</strong> (degradation of formerly productive land  &ndash; usually at least semi-arid) and <strong role="strong">soil erosion</strong>.</p><p>Agriculture, deforestation, overgrazing, and development can remove vegetation to cause unnatural levels of erosion by wind and water. In the U.S., erosion forced its way into public awareness during the 1930s after drought compounded exposed soils. The famous Dust Bowl (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.27 <a href="#Bio18-02-06-fig" id="Bio18-02-06-text">below</a>) resulted in the loss of at least 5 inches of topsoil from nearly 10 million acres of land and the migration of 2.5 million people out of the Great Plains. Today in the U.S., contour plowing, cover crops, terracing, strip farming, no-till farming, reforestation, and better construction practices prevent some soil erosion (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.28 <a href="#Bio18-02-07-fig" id="Bio18-02-07-text">below: conservation practices</a>), but the USDA reports that 1.6 billion metric tons of topsoil were lost annually between 1997 and 2001. Since Great Plains agriculture began some 200 years ago, the U.S. has lost one-third of its topsoil. Alarming rates of slash-and-burn agriculture in tropical forests expose thin soils to erosion, and development in China sends 1.6 billion tons of sediment annually into the Yellow River.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2952" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio18-02-06-text" id="Bio18-02-06-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.27 <caption>Soil erosion in the U.S. peaked during the Dust Bowl years of 1933-1939.

Modification of land for these uses inevitably alters ecosystems, and in many cases, the resulting urban sprawl, pollution, salination, erosion, and/or desertification lead to the loss of species, as well. As you learned in the lesson on biodiversity, habitat loss is the primary cause of extinction. Within the past 100 years, the area of land cultivated worldwide has increased 74%; grazing land increased 113%. Agriculture has cost the United States 50% of its wetlands and 99% of its tallgrass prairies. Land changes also result in fragmentation, yet another threat to biodiversity. Pressures from population growth cause the loss of land for human use, as well: ecologist David Pimental reports that erosion and salination destroy more than 2 million acres of prime agricultural land each year, and urban growth, transportation systems, and industry remove a million additional acres from production. Global increases in cropland and pasture from 1700 to 1990 are shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.29 <a href="#Bio182-08-fig" id="Bio182-08-text">below</a>.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2997" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio182-08-text" id="Bio182-08-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.29 <caption>Changes in land use from 1700 to 1990 show the conversion of forests, grasslands, steppes, shrubland, and savannas to cropland (red) and grazing (pink).</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>Land use changes affect global processes as well as the ecosystems they directly involve. Deforestation &ndash; even if it is replaced by agriculture &ndash; reduces photosynthesis, which means that less CO<sub>2</sub> is removed from the atmosphere. The result is that CO<sub>2</sub> builds up &ndash; and as you will see in the fourth lesson of this chapter, an increase in CO<sub>2</sub> means an increase in the <strong role="strong">greenhouse effect</strong> and <strong role="strong">global warming</strong>. The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that land use change contributes 1.6 gigatons of carbon (as CO<sub>2</sub>) per year to the atmosphere. This is highly significant when compared to the better-known fossil fuel-burning carbon contributions of 6.3 gigatons.</p><p>Urbanization and industry contribute to yet another land use issue that affects water resources and the atmosphere. Increasingly, impervious surfaces such as parking lots, building roofs, streets and roadways are covering land areas. Impervious surfaces prevent water infiltration and groundwater recharge, increasing runoff and altering waterways. They deprive tree roots of aeration and water, decreasing productivity and increasing CO<sub>2</sub>. Far more than vegetated surfaces, they absorb solar radiation and convert it to heat, increasing runoff, which eventually degrades streams. In the U.S., impervious surfaces cover an area almost as large as the state of Ohio. Solutions to this harmful impact include the development of porous pavements and green roofs (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.30 <a href="#Bio18-02-09-fig" id="Bio18-02-09-text">below</a>).</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2970" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio18-02-09-text" id="Bio18-02-09-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.30 <caption>Impervious surfaces (left) fragment habitats, increase runoff, degrade water sources, reduce photosynthesis, and effectively increase CO in the atmosphere.

Permeable pavements and green roofs (right) are beginning to reverse their effects.</caption></p></div><p> </p><h3>Water Resources</h3><p>At the intersection of land and water resources are <strong role="strong">wetlands</strong>: swamps, marshes and bogs whose soil is saturated (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.31 <a href="#Bio182-10-fig" id="Bio182-10-text">below</a>). Historically, humans have viewed wetlands as wasted land; the U.S. has lost as much of 50% of its wetlands to agriculture, development, and flood control. Recently, wetland loss and the loss wetland species has taught us the importance of this ecosystem. Ecosystem services provided by wetlands include:</p><ol start><li>water storage and replenishment of aquifers </li><li>protection of coastlands from tides and storms </li><li>flood control </li><li>water purification I: slowing of water flow allows sedimentation to remove particulates </li><li>water purification II: denitrification of excess nutrients </li><li>rich habitat for wildlife </li><li>rich habitat for plants (30% of U.S. plant diversity) </li><li>recreation: hunting, fishing, ecotourism (e.g., The Everglades) </li></ol><p>In the U.S., at least, recognition of the economic value and biodiversity of wetlands has led to restoration efforts and requirements for replacement of those lost through development. The Ramsar &ldquo;Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, especially as Waterfowl Habitat,&rdquo; signed by 18 nations in 1971, works to conserve wetlands throughout the world for their ecological services and their economic, scientific, cultural, and recreational values. Signatories today number 157, and they meet every 3 years.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2980" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio182-10-text" id="Bio182-10-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.31 <caption>Wetlands such as this area in Cape May, New Jersey, filter water both physically and chemically, protect coastal lands from storms and floods, and harbor an exceptional diversity of plants and animals.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>Water is the quintessential resource of life; its unique physical, chemical and biological properties make it difficult for us to imagine life on any planet which lacks liquid water. For human use, however, water must be fresh. About 97% of Earth&rsquo;s water is found in the oceans. Of the 3% which is fresh water, over 2/3 is locked in ice. The 1% which is fresh liquid water is mostly below ground, leaving just 0.3% as surface water in lakes and rivers (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.32 <a href="#Bio18-02-11-fig" id="Bio18-02-11-text">below</a>).

Over-drafting has lowered water tables in Texas, California, and India, leaving many wells dry. New Orleans is below sea level, and San Jose, California dropped 13 feet, because over-pumping caused the land to subside. The UN and others have labeled the current state of water resources throughout the world a Water Crisis (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.33 <a href="#Bio182-12-fig" id="Bio182-12-text">below</a>). You might wonder why we don&rsquo;t tap the oceans; the answer is that desalination is extremely costly in terms of energy and economics. The UN estimates that 1.1 billion people worldwide are without adequate fresh water, and that 2.6 billion lack enough water for sanitation to protect from disease. Water conflicts in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Korea have threatened regional political stability.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2943" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio182-12-text" id="Bio182-12-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.33 <caption>International Water Management Institute predicts expanding water shortages by 2025. The UN suggests a worldwide Water Crisis already exists. This map may oversimplify water problems; in the US, at least, drought and overdraft already threaten municipal and agricultural water supplies.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>Water pollution, especially from <strong role="strong">nonpoint sources</strong> or runoff, threatens vital freshwater and marine resources in the U.S. and throughout the world. A single example dramatically illustrates the potential for disruption of natural cycles and loss of biodiversity. Runoff of fertilizers applied to vast expanses of agricultural land and other sources such as wastewater have led to what ecologists say is a doubling of the amount of nitrogen available to plants and animals, and that amount could increase by another 60% by 2050. At first glance this may seem like a benefit to life, but it is not. Especially in aquatic ecosystems, excessive nutrients lead to overgrowth of algae, creating <strong role="strong">algal blooms</strong>. Some species are toxic in themselves, but more often, this <strong role="strong">eutrophication</strong> - literally, &ldquo;feeding too well&rdquo; - leads to such high levels of respiration (recall that photosynthesizers must respirate &ndash; especially at night!) that dissolved oxygen levels plummet, resulting in the death of fish and other species. Death results in decomposition and further nutrient input &ndash; compounding the problem. Eutrophication threatens one of the most diverse habitats on earth &ndash; coral reefs, which cover just 1% of the earth&rsquo;s surface yet harbor 25% (over 4000) - of marine fish species. Adapted to low-nutrient environments and characterized by tight nutrient cycles, reefs in the pathway of excess nutrient runoff from agriculture and development become overgrown with algae, which block light from coral polyps. The Nature Conservancy predicts that 70% of Earth&rsquo;s coral reefs will have disappeared by 2050 if current rates of destruction continue.</p><p>Among the most devastating consequences of eutrophication are at least 146 <strong role="strong">dead zones</strong>, where low oxygen levels caused by eutrophication have extinguished all ocean life. The most notorious extends into the Gulf of Mexico at the mouth of the Mississippi River, which brings fertilizer runoff from the U.S. corn belt (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.34 <a href="#Bio18-02-13-fig" id="Bio18-02-13-text">below</a>). In July of 2007, this dead zone covered an area of ocean the size of New Jersey and affected shrimp and fishing industries as well as countless species of marine organisms. Interestingly, a similar zone in the Black Sea disappeared between 1991 and 2001, after political changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe made fertilizers too expensive to use for most agriculture. Unfortunately, most are growing, and the nitrogen cycle disruption affects many bodies of freshwater throughout the world, as well.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2964" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio18-02-13-text" id="Bio18-02-13-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.34 <caption>Eutrophication destroys marine and freshwater habitats and threatens biodiversity.

It is an important concept in the conservation of water resources.</p><p><strong role="strong">Virtual water</strong> is the water used in the production of a good or service. Although it is no longer contained in the product, its use is a part of the cost of production, and as such should be factored into the product&rsquo;s value. Here are some estimates of virtual water &ldquo;contained&rdquo; in various products, from the United Nations Education, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Institute for Water Education:</p><ul><li>1 kg wheat:1,300 liters </li><li>1 kg beef:15,000 liters </li><li>1 pair of jeans: 10,850 liters </li></ul><p>The more water we use, the more likely we are to draw down wells and rivers beyond the hydrologic cycle&rsquo;s power to recharge them. The more water we use, the more we are likely to pollute the 1% of Earth&rsquo;s waters which are fresh (as well as the oceans). Protecting soils and lands (especially wetlands and watersheds) is a critical part of protecting water resources, because the hydrologic cycle integrates terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.</p><p>Thus, as for all conservation (wise use) or <strong role="strong">sustainable use</strong> (meeting needs of the present without impairing those of future generations), the first step is to reduce our use of water. This and other strategies to protect our water resources are summarized below. Don&rsquo;t forget the list of what you can do as an individual, at the end of the lesson on biodiversity!</p><p>1. Reduce the use of water, and the abuse of soil, land, and wetlands.</p><ul><li>Landscape with native, drought-resistant vegetation. </li><li>Use low-flow toilets, faucets, and showerheads. Check out possible local government subsidies for installing these water saving mechanisms. </li><li>Purchase foods from water-efficient crops which do not require irrigation. </li></ul><p>2. Reuse water where appropriate.</p><ul><li>Gray water, which has been used for laundry or washing, can be used to water gardens or flush toilets. </li><li>On a municipal level, sewage water can be used for fountains, watering public parks or golf courses, fire fighting, and irrigating crops that will be boiled or peeled before consumption. </li></ul><p>3. Catch runoff, which will also slow non-point source pollution and erosion.</p><ul><li>Place rainbarrels adjacent to buildings. </li><li>Recharge pits which will re-fill aquifers. </li></ul><p>4. Support legislation that reduces pollution.</p><ul><li>For example in the U.S., the 1977 Clean Water Act, through the EPA, regulates industrial discharge of contaminants and sets standards for water quality. </li></ul><p>5. Work locally, nationally and internationally to make clean fresh water available.</p><ul><li>The United Nations Depart of Economic and Social Affairs has initiated a second Decade for Water for Life, 2005-2015 to increase awareness of water shortages and work toward sustainable use of freshwater resources. </li><li>The World Water Council unites 300 member organizations from 60 countries to work to &ldquo;build political commitment and trigger action on critical water issues at all levels... to facilitate the efficient management and use of water &hellip;on an environmentally sustainable basis.&rdquo; </li></ul><h3>Lesson Summary</h3><ul><li>One&rsquo;s definition of natural resources clarifies human relationships and responsibilities to the Earth. </li><li>Robert Hartwell&rsquo;s definition defines natural resources as: &ldquo;something supplied by nature which supports life on this planet.&rdquo; This definition includes ecosystems, ecosystem services, biodiversity, energy sources and raw materials. </li><li>Renewable resources are replenished by natural processes as fast as, or faster than humans consume them. </li><li>A non-renewable resource is not regenerated or restored on a time scale comparative to its consumption. Fossil fuels are a classic example of nonrenewable resources. </li><li>In practice, pressure from growing populations and increasing industrialization can lead to overconsumption and/or degradation, changing a renewable resource into a non-renewable resource. </li><li>According to the Laws of Energy, energy resources are not renewable because they get used up, but materials or matter is constant because it can theoretically be recycled. </li><li>The concept of sustainable use &ndash; the use of resources at a rate which meets the needs of the present without impairing the ability of future generations to meet their needs &ndash; may be more helpful in decision making. </li><li>The world&rsquo;s current energy use is unsustainable, especially if increases in developing countries are considered. </li><li>Soils are complex mixtures which evolved over thousands of years to support terrestrial ecosystems. </li><li>Humans use soils for agriculture, forestry, and waste disposal. </li><li>Although soils have been considered renewable resources, human activities have changed them through: </li></ul><ol start><li>Contamination with heavy metals and toxins </li><li>Acidification </li><li>Erosion </li><li>Salination </li><li>Conversion to cropland, cattle production, forestry, and urban centers </li></ol><ul><li>Despite soil conservation practices, the U.S. continues to lose topsoil to erosion, and developing countries are losing even more. </li><li>Land resources are used for agriculture, forestry, industry, mining, waste disposal, and urban areas. </li><li>In the process of converting land resources, the U.S. has lost: </li></ul><ol start><li>99% of tallgrass prairies </li><li>at least 50% of wetlands </li><li>an area the size of Ohio to impervious surfaces </li></ol><ul><li>Worldwide, conversion of forests to other uses, especially by slash-and-burn, adds CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere and reduces the potential for absorption of CO<sub>2</sub> by photosynthesis, adding to greenhouse gases. </li><li>Wetlands, greatly reduced because of earlier views that they were wasted land, provide many ecosystem services, including flood control, water purification, aquifer recharge, plant and wildlife habitat, and recreation. </li><li>Liquid fresh water, the primary water resource for human use, comprises less than 1% of all water on Earth; most of this is groundwater. </li><li>As industry, agriculture, development, and a growing world population use more water, fresh water supplies are shrinking due to over-drafting of groundwater and pollution of surface and groundwater. </li><li>According to the United Nations, the current Water Crisis involves 1.1 billion people without adequate water supplies and 2.6 billion people who lack adequate water for sanitation. </li><li>Agricultural fertilizer runoff and waste water add excess nutrients to surface waters, leading to algal blooms and eutrophication. </li><li>Dead zones in coastal areas such as the Gulf of Mexico result from agricultural runoff from large areas of land. The dead zone at the mouth of the Mississippi River was the size of New Jersey in the summer of 2007. </li><li>Virtual water is the water used in the production of a good or service. </li><li>The more water we use, the more likely we are to overdraft aquifers and pollute water supplies. </li><li>Concepts similar to virtual water highlight the importance of REDUCING USE as a first principle in conservation or sustainable use. </li><li>A second principle is to REUSE resources. For water conservation, this can mean re-using gray water from laundry or showers for gardens or flush toilets. </li><li>Legislation can set standards for water quality and limits on pollution. </li><li>Local, national, and international organizations can work to promote awareness and encourage action. </li></ul><h3>Review Questions</h3><ol start><li>Distinguish between renewable and nonrenewable resources, and relate these concepts to the Laws of Energy.</li><li>Classify the following resources as renewable or nonrenewable: coal, copper, iron, natural gas, nuclear power, oxygen, sunlight, water, wood, wool. Briefly explain your reasoning for each resource.</li><li>Describe the formation of soil, and classify it as a renewable or nonrenewable resource.</li><li>Compare and contrast land which has undergone desertification to ecosystems which harbor natural deserts. How can the apparently life-promoting act of irrigation eventually have the opposite effect?</li><li>We no longer experience the obvious tragedies associated with the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. Does this mean that soil erosion is no longer a significant problem?</li><li>Connect land use changes (e.g. forest to agriculture) to global warming. How important is this relationship?</li><li>List the ecosystem services of wetlands, and describe the extent of their loss.</li><li>Earth is the &ldquo;water planet.&rdquo; Why are we threatened with a Water Crisis?</li><li>Explain why eutrophication &ndash; &ldquo;too much a good thing&rdquo; results in problems for aquatic life.</li><li>Analyze the disappearance of the Black Sea &ldquo;dead zone&rdquo; for its potential to help solve water pollution problems.</li></ol><h3>Further Reading / Supplemental Links</h3><ul><li>Schumacher, E.
