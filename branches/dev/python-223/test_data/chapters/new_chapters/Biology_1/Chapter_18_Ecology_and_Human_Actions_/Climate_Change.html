A high honor, the award also announced to the world that climate change (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.49 <a href="#Bio184-01-fig" id="Bio184-01-text">below</a>) is a critical issues for the future of the Earth and its people. What is climate change? What are its causes? How do its effects relate to world peace? What are &ldquo;the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change&rdquo;? Can individuals like us help? These are the questions we will explore in this last lesson about human ecology.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2940" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio184-01-text" id="Bio184-01-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.49 <caption>Temperature variations from 1940-1980 averages show that most of the Earth warmed significantly in just a single decade.

Without the Greenhouse Effect, Earth&rsquo;s surface temperature would average -18<sup>o</sup>C (0<sup>o</sup>F) &ndash; a temperature far too cold to support life as we know it. With the Greenhouse Effect, Earth&rsquo;s surface temperature averages 15<sup>o</sup>C (59<sup>o</sup>F), and it is this temperature range to which today&rsquo;s diversity of life has adapted.</p><p>How does this ecosystem service work? The Greenhouse Effect is summarized in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.50 <a href="#Bio18-04-02-fig" id="Bio18-04-02-text">below</a>. Of the solar radiation which reaches the Earth&rsquo;s surface, as much as 30% is reflected back into space. About 70% is absorbed as heat, warming the land, waters, and atmosphere (you may recall that only about 1% is converted to chemical energy by photosynthesis). If there were no atmosphere, most of the heat would radiate back out into space as infrared radiation. Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, however, contains molecules of water (H<sub>2</sub>O), carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), which absorb some of the infrared radiation. Some of this absorbed radiation further warms the atmosphere, and some is emitted, radiating back down to the Earth&rsquo;s surface or out into space. A balance between the heat which is absorbed and the heat which is radiated out into space results in an equilibrium which maintains a constant average temperature for the Earth and its life.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2993" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio18-04-02-text" id="Bio18-04-02-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.50 <caption>Without greenhouse gases, most of the suns energy (transformed to heat) would be radiated back out into space. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb and reflect back to the surface much of the heat which would otherwise be radiated.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>If we compare Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere to the atmospheres which surround Mars and Venus (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.51 <a href="#Bio184-03a-fig" id="Bio184-03a-text">below</a>), we can better understand the precision and value of Earth&rsquo;s thermal equilibrium. Mars&rsquo; atmosphere is very thin, exerting less than 1% of the surface pressure of our own. As you might expect, the thin atmosphere cannot hold heat from the sun, and the average surface temperature is -55<sup>o</sup>C (-67<sup>o</sup>F) &ndash; even though that atmosphere is 95% CO<sub>2</sub> and contains a great deal of dust. Daily variations in temperature are extreme, because the atmosphere cannot hold heat.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2955" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio184-03a-text" id="Bio184-03a-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.51 <caption>The thickness of a planets atmosphere strongly influences its temperature through the Greenhouse Effect. Mars (left) has an extremely thin atmosphere, and an average temperature near -55C. Venus (right) has a far more dense atmosphere than Earth, and surface temperatures reach 500C.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>In contrast, Venus&rsquo; atmosphere is much thicker than Earth&rsquo;s, exerting 92 times the surface pressure of our own. Moreover, 96% of the atmosphere is CO<sub>2</sub>, so a strong Greenhouse Effect heats the surface temperature of Venus as high as 500<sup>o</sup>C, hottest of any planet in our solar system. The thick atmosphere prevents heat from escaping at night, so daily variations are minimal. Venus&rsquo; atmosphere has many layers which vary in composition, and scientists have identified a layer about 50 km from the surface which could harbor liquid water and perhaps even life; some scientists propose that this would be a reasonable location for a space station. Near this altitude, pressure is similar to the Earth&rsquo;s sea level pressure, and temperatures range from 20<sup>o</sup>C to 37<sup>o</sup>C. Nitrogen, though only 3.5% of Venus&rsquo; atmosphere, is present in the same overall amounts as on Earth (because the density on Venus is so much greater); oxygen, however, is absent, and sulfuric acid would present challenges.</p><p>Considering the extremes of Greenhouse Effects on Mars and Venus, we can better appreciate the precise balance which allows our own atmosphere to provide temperatures hospitable to liquid water and life. Inevitably, we must also ask this chapter&rsquo;s repeating query: how have human activities affected this equilibrium? This leads us back to the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, and an evolving consensus that our species is responsible for significant global warming.</p><h3>Global Warming</h3><p><strong role="strong">Global warming</strong> refers to the recent increase in the Earth&rsquo;s average near-surface and ocean temperatures (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.52 <a href="#Bio184-05-fig" id="Bio184-05-text">below</a>). During the past 100 years, surface air temperatures have risen 0.74 &plusmn; 0.18 &deg;C (1.33 &plusmn; 0.32 &deg;F).

Rapid buildup of greenhouse gases in the Jurassic Period 180 million years ago correlates with a rise in temperature of 5<sup>o</sup>C (9<sup>o</sup>F). Similar changes have been hypothesized as causes for the dramatic Permian Extinction 250 million years ago and the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (one of the most rapid and extreme global warming events recorded in geologic history) 55 million years ago. Paleoclimatologist William Ruddiman proposes that human activities began to affect global CO<sub>2</sub> levels as long ago as 8,000 years, when agriculture and deforestation began. Ruddiman argues that without this early contribution to greenhouse gases, cycles indicate the Earth would already have entered another Ice Age.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2992" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio184-07-text" id="Bio184-07-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.55 <caption>Over the past 450,000 years, temperature changes (blue) correlate closely with changes in atmospheric CO (green) and dust levels (red).</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>Others dispute Ruddiman&rsquo;s &ldquo;overdue-glaciation&rdquo; theory, but most scientists today agree that recent global warming since 1850 is caused by an unprecedented rise in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.56 <a href="#Bio18-04-08-fig" id="Bio18-04-08-text">below</a>) which resulted from human activities &ndash; primarily burning of fossil fuels, but also continuing deforestation and changes in land use. Fossil fuels burn organic compounds in the same way your cells burn glucose to make ATP: a product of both reactions is CO<sub>2</sub>. Deforestation and other land use changes contributes to the CO<sub>2</sub> levels from the opposite direction &ndash; a decrease in photosynthesis, which would have removed CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere. Slash-and-burn destruction of tropical forests combines the worst of both worlds; burning adds CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere, and the loss of layers of vegetation decreases CO<sub>2</sub> use.</p><p>Two additional greenhouse gases having anthropogenic (human activity) sources are methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and nitrous oxide (NO). Agriculture adds both of these to the atmosphere; cattle production is responsible for much of the methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. Land use changes, waste processing, and fossil fuel production, which we&rsquo;ve already implicated in CO<sub>2</sub> increases, are other <strong role="strong">anthropogenic</strong> (human-caused) sources.

The awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the organization which focuses most directly on climate change, the IPCC, highlights this consensus.

Both oceans and permafrost currently trap huge quantities of methane &ndash; beneath sediments and surface &ndash; which would undergo massive releases if temperatures reach a critical point. Recall that methane is one of the most powerful greenhouse gases, so the next step would be further increase in temperatures. Warmer oceans and more thawed permafrost would release more quantities of methane &ndash; and so on. These compounding effects are perhaps the most convincing arguments to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emission and global warming.</p><p>What measures have been considered?</p><h3>Preventing Climate Change</h3><p>Basically, greenhouse gases are products of fossil fuel combustion; according to the EPA, more than 90% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions come from burning oil, coal, and natural gas. Therefore, energy use is the primary target for attempts to reduce future global warming.  In <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.61 <a href="#Bio184-13a-fig" id="Bio184-13a-text">below</a> you can see the sources of emission for three major greenhouse gases in 2000, when CO<sub>2</sub> was 72% of the total, CH<sub>4</sub> 18%, and NO 9%. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs, HCFCs, and HFCs) are also greenhouse gases; refer to the lesson on The Atmosphere for more information about them.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2975" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio184-13a-text" id="Bio184-13a-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.61 <caption>Global greenhouse emissions during 2002 show sources for each of the three major greenhouse gases. Knowing the causes makes finding solutions clear, but not necessarily easy!</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>Knowing the causes of climate change allows us to develop potential solutions. Direct causes include combustion of fossil fuels, deforestation and other land use changes, cattle production, agriculture, and use of chlorofluorocarbons. Runaway effects can result from temperature-dependent release of methane from permafrost and ocean sediments, and forest fires or intentional burning. Unfortunately, the best way to avoid runaway effects is to prevent temperature increases. Prevention, then, should address as many of these causes as possible. A partial list of solutions being considered and adopted follows.</p><ol start><li>Reduce energy use. </li><li>Switch to cleaner &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; energy sources, such as hydrogen, solar, wind, geothermal, waste methane, and/or biomass. </li><li>Increase fuel efficiencies of vehicles, buildings, power plants, and more. </li><li>Increase <strong role="strong">carbon (CO<sub>2</sub>) sinks</strong>, which absorb CO<sub>2</sub> - e.g., by planting forests. </li><li><strong role="strong">Cap emissions</strong> release, through national and/or international legislation, alone or in combination with carbon offset options (see below). </li><li>Sell or trade <strong role="strong">carbon offsets or carbon credits</strong>. Credits or offsets exchange reductions in CO<sub>2</sub> or greenhouse emissions (tree-planting, investment in alternative energy sources, methane capture technologies) for rights to increase CO<sub>2</sub> (personally, as for air travel, or industry-wide). </li><li>Key urban planning to energy use, e.g., efficient public transportation. </li><li>Develop <strong role="strong">planetary engineering</strong>: radical changes in technology (such as building solar shades of dust, sulfates, or microballoons in the stratosphere), culture (population control), or the biosphere (e.g. iron-seeding of the oceans to produce more phytoplankton to absorb more CO<sub>2</sub>). </li><li>Legislate Action: International agreements such as the 2005 Kyoto Protocol (which the US has not yet ratified), or national carbon taxes or caps on emissions. Interestingly, in the U.S., some States and groups of States are taking the lead here. </li><li>Set goals of carbon neutrality: in 2007, the Vatican announced plans to become the first <strong role="strong">carbon-neutral</strong> state. </li><li>Support developing nations in their efforts to industrialize and increase standards of living without adding to greenhouse gas production. </li></ol><p>Every potential solution has costs and benefits which must be carefully considered. Human health, cultural diversity, socioeconomics, and political impacts must be considered and kept in balance. For example, nuclear power involves fewer greenhouse gas emissions, but adds the new problems of longterm radioactive waste transport and storage, danger of radiation exposure to humans and the environment, centralization of power production, and limited supplies of &ldquo;clean&rdquo; uranium fuels. Studies of costs and benefits can result in solutions which make effective tradeoffs and therefore progress toward the goal of lowering greenhouse gases and minimizing future global warming.</p><p>We have reached the point where we understand how and the extent to which our activities have destabilized the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere and reduced and threatened its ecosystem services. Now we need to move one step further, and put our knowledge to work in the form of action.</p><p>What will you do to help?</p><h3>Lesson Summary</h3><ul><li>The awarding of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and former US Vice President Al Gore recognizes the potential impact of global warming on the economic, social, and political welfare of the world. </li></ul><ul><li>The greenhouse effect is an ecosystem service which warms the Earth to temperatures which support life. </li><li>The greenhouse effect involves water, carbon dioxide, methane, and ozone, which absorb heat that would otherwise be radiated out into space. </li><li>Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere maintains an equilibrium between heat added by sunlight and heat lost by radiation. </li><li>The atmosphere of Mars is too thin to hold heat, and that of Venus is so thick that temperatures reach 500<sup>o</sup>C. </li><li>In 2000, the major greenhouse gases were CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and NO; CFCs and H<sub>2</sub>O contribute, as well. </li><li>Global warming refers to an increase in the Earth&rsquo;s temperature of 0.74&deg;C (1.33&deg;F) within the past 100 years. </li></ul><ul><li>Paleoclimatologists document changes in the Earth&rsquo;s temperature over millions of years which cycle between tropical and ice age extremes &ndash; a variation of 10<sup>o</sup>C. </li><li>Greenhouse gases, especially CO<sub>2</sub> levels, often correlate with temperature changes. </li><li>Deforestation and agriculture &ndash; by reducing levels of CO<sub>2</sub> uptake &ndash; may have initiated warming 8,000 years ago. </li><li>Most scientists today agree that fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and agriculture contribute to greenhouse gases and the greenhouse effect. </li><li>Global warming can cause physical changes for the Earth: melting of glaciers and permafrost, changes in precipitation patterns, temperature extremes, warming and acidification of the oceans, and ozone depletion. </li><li>Melting of oceans and permafrost can release methane, resulting in a &ldquo;runaway greenhouse effect.&rdquo; </li><li>Ecological effects may include loss of biodiversity and addition of still more CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere. </li><li>Socioeconomic threats include crop losses, increased disease, water scarcity, and coastal flooding. </li><li>Population growth and socioeconomic factors (especially interference with third world development) can combine to produce political instability and conflict. </li></ul><ul><li>Most greenhouse gases are products of fossil fuel combustion, so reduced use, increased efficiency, and alternative fuel development are primary means of prevention of climate change. </li><li>CO<sub>2</sub> uptake can be increased by eliminating deforestation, reforestation, and green roofs technology. </li><li>Legislation from local to international levels can cap emissions and develop carbon offset trading. </li><li>Careful urban planning can increase the efficiency of transportation and energy use. </li><li>Planetary engineering could enact radical changes in technology, culture, or the biosphere. </li><li>Support of third world efforts to develop without adding greenhouse gases could improve global stability. </li><li>Every potential solution has costs and benefits which must be carefully considered; tradeoffs are necessary. </li></ul><h3>Review Questions</h3><ol start><li>Explain the mechanism of the greenhouse effect.</li><li>Compare the effects of the greenhouse effect on Mars and Venus to that on Earth.</li><li>Define and quantify global warming.</li><li>Describe paleoclimatic changes over the course of Earth&rsquo;s history.
