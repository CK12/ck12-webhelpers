<h2>Lesson 16.2: Terrestrial Biomes</h2><h3>Lesson Objectives</h3><ul><li>State how terrestrial biomes are classified and distributed around the globe. </li><li>Outline abiotic and biotic factors in tundra and boreal forest biomes. </li><li>Describe climatic factors and organisms of temperate zone biomes. </li><li>List abiotic factors in deserts and adaptations of desert organisms. </li><li>Identify abiotic factors and organisms in tropical biomes. </li></ul><h3>Introduction</h3><p>Terrestrial biomes include all land areas on Earth where organisms live. The major biomes cover large regions and are found on more than one continent. They are generally classified on the basis of climatic factors and the types of plants that are the primary producers.</p><h3>Classification of Terrestrial Biomes</h3><p>Scientists have created several different systems for classifying terrestrial biomes. Biomes in most classification systems include tundra, boreal forest, temperate forest, temperate grassland, chaparral, tropical forest, tropical grassland, and desert. The worldwide distribution of these biomes is shown in <strong role="strong">Figure 1</strong>.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2885" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#BioII-1602-01-text" id="BioII-1602-01-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.7 <caption>Distribution of Earths major terrestrial biomes.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>The distribution of biomes shown in <strong role="strong">Figure 1</strong> reflects global patterns of temperature and moisture. It also reflects conditions in earlier times. Many areas have been disturbed by human actions, some more so than others. For example, most tundra biomes have been changed very little by human actions, but many forests have been completely cleared. Some biomes, including tropical rainforests, cannot be replaced once they have been destroyed. <strong role="strong">Figure 2</strong> summarizes important features of most of the biomes shown in <strong role="strong">Figure 1</strong>.

The biomes include tundra and boreal forests. Both have cold, dry climates and poor soil. They can support only limited plant growth and have low biodiversity.</p><h4>Tundra</h4><p><strong role="strong">Tundra</strong> is an arctic biome where it is too cold for trees to grow. Outside of the polar ice caps, tundra has the coldest temperatures on Earth. There are two types of tundra: arctic tundra, which is also found in Antarctica, and alpine tundra, which is found only at high altitudes.</p><ul><li><strong role="strong">Arctic tundra</strong> occurs north of the arctic circle and south of the antarctic circle. It covers much of Alaska and vast areas of northern Canada and Russia. It is also found along the northern coast of Antarctica. </li><li><strong role="strong">Alpine tundra</strong> occurs in mountains around the world at any latitude, but only above the tree line. The <strong role="strong">tree line</strong> is the edge of the zone at which trees are able to survive. Alpine tundra is found in the Rocky Mountains in the United States and in several other mountain ranges around the world.</li></ul><p>Both types of tundra receive very low precipitation, but little of it evaporates because of the cold. Arctic tundra has <strong role="strong">permafrost,</strong> which is soil that is frozen year-round. The top layer of soil thaws in the summer, but deeper layers do not. As a result, water cannot soak into the ground. This leaves the soil soggy and creates many bogs, lakes, and streams. Alpine tundra does not have permafrost, except at very high altitudes. Therefore, alpine tundra soil tends to be dry rather than soggy.</p><p>Global warming poses a serious threat to Arctic tundra biomes because it is causing the permafrost to melt. When permafrost melts, it not only changes the tundra. It also releases large amounts of methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Both are greenhouse gases, which contribute to greater global warming.</p><p>The most common vegetation in tundra is mosses and lichens. They can grow in very little soil and become dormant during the winter. Tundra is too cold for amphibians or reptiles, which cannot regulate their own body heat. Insects such as mosquitoes can survive the winter as pupae and are very numerous in summer. In addition, many species of birds and large herds of caribou migrate to arctic tundra each summer. However, few birds and mammals live there year-round. Those that remain have adapted to the extreme cold. Polar bears are an example. They have very thick fur to insulate them from the cold. In alpine tundra, animals must adapt to rugged terrain as well as to cold. Alpine animals include mountain goats, which not only have wool to keep them warm but are also sure-footed and agile.</p><h4>Boreal Forests</h4><p>A <strong role="strong">boreal forest</strong> is a subarctic biome covered with conifers. Conifers are cone-bearing, needle-leaved evergreen trees such as spruces. Boreal forests are found only in the northern hemisphere. They occur just south of the arctic circle in Alaska, Canada, northern Europe, and Russia (where they are called taiga). They also occur in extreme northern regions of Minnesota, New York State, New Hampshire, and Maine.</p><p>Boreal forests have harsh continental climates, with very cold winters and relatively warm summers. The growing season is also short. Precipitation is quite low, but there is little evaporation. Most of the precipitation falls in the summer when plants are growing, so there is enough moisture for dense plant growth. A thick carpet of evergreen needles on the forest floor causes the soil to be too acidic for most other plants.</p><p>Conifers have adapted to the difficult conditions in several ways. They have shallow roots that suit them for the thin soil. They have needles instead of leaves, which reduce water loss during the long, dry winters. The needles are also very dark green in color, which maximizes absorption of sunlight for photosynthesis. Although boreal forests are dense with conifers, there are only a few different species of trees. Vegetation on the forest floor consists mostly of mosses and lichens. Animals found in boreal forests include insects, birds, and mammals such as rabbits, foxes, and brown bears. Caribou also spend their winters there. Like tundra, the boreal forest is too cold for amphibians or reptiles.</p><h3>Temperate Biomes</h3><p>Temperate biomes cover most of the continental United States and Europe. They also cover large parts of Asia. Types of temperate biomes include forests, grasslands, and chaparral.</p><h4>Temperate Forests</h4><p>There are two types of temperate forests: temperate deciduous forests and temperate rainforests. Both types have a temperate climate and good soil. A temperate climate is a moderate climate that is neither extremely hot nor extremely cold. A temperate climate can be either continental or coastal. Continental temperate climates are found inland, and they tend to have cold winters, hot summers, and moderate precipitation. Coastal temperate climates are found near the ocean, and they tend to have mild winters, cool summers, and high precipitation.</p><ul><li><strong role="strong">Temperate deciduous forests</strong> are found in areas with continental temperate climates, such as the eastern United States and Canada and throughout much of Europe. These forests consist mainly of deciduous trees, such as maples and oaks, which lose their leaves in the fall. There are many other species of plants as well. Animals include insects, amphibians, reptiles, and birds. Mammals are also common, including rabbits and wolves. </li><li><strong role="strong">Temperate rainforests</strong> are found in areas with coastal temperate climates, such as the northwestern coast of North America and certain coastal regions of other continents. These forests consist mainly of evergreen trees, such as hemlocks and firs. Mosses, lichens, and ferns grow on the forest floor. There are also many epiphytic plants. Animals include insects, amphibians, reptiles, and birds. There are also many mammals, such as squirrels and deer.</li></ul><p><strong role="strong">Epiphytes</strong> are plants that grow on other plants. They use the other  plants for support, not nutrients, and generally do not harm the plants they grow on. They grow high in the branches of trees where there is more sunlight available for photosynthesis.</p><h4>Temperate Grasslands</h4><p><strong role="strong">Temperate grasslands</strong> are temperate biomes that consist mainly of grasses. They are found in the midwestern region of North America and in inland areas of most other continents. The climate is continental, and precipitation is relatively low. However, the majority of the precipitation falls during the growing season when plants need it the most.</p><p>Biomes are often referred to by local names. For example, a temperate grassland biome is known  as prairie in North America, outback in Australia, pampa in South America, and steppe in central Asia. Can you find each of these temperate grasslands on the map in <strong role="strong">Figure 1</strong>?</p><p>The soil of temperate grasslands is the richest, deepest soil on Earth. It is densely covered with thick grasses that decompose to add large amounts of organic matter and nutrients to the soil. Grasses also have thick mats of roots that hold the soil in place and prevent erosion. The low rainfall does not leach many nutrients from the soil, but it does lead to frequent fires. The fires help prevent woody vegetation from moving in if a grassland is disturbed. This is because grasses can grow back after a fire, whereas most woody plants cannot.</p><p>The rich, deep soil supports high productivity. This is why the temperate grassland of the US midwest is known as the <em>Breadbasket of America.</em> Grass plants are closely spaced and can support many herbivore consumers. These range from grasshoppers to deer. Many worms and other invertebrates (animals without a backbone) consume organic matter in the soil. Grassland animals also include carnivores such as foxes and coyotes.</p><h4>Chaparral</h4><p><strong role="strong">Chaparral</strong> is a shrub forest biome dominated by densely-growing evergreen shrubs or small trees, such as scrub oak. There are few other species of plants. Chaparral is found mainly in central and southern California and around the Mediterranean Sea. The climate, called a Mediterranean climate, has mild wet winters and hot dry summers. Fires are frequent because of the summer dryness, and the soil is relatively poor.</p><p>The majority of chaparral trees and plants are adapted to the dry summers. For example:</p><ul><li>Trees are short, which reduces their need for water. </li><li>Many plants are dormant during the dry season, which also reduces water needs. </li><li>The leaves of some plants have waxy coatings, which reduce water loss. </li></ul><p>Most chaparral plants are adapted to frequent fires, as well. For example:</p><ul><li>Many plants can grow back quickly from the roots after burning to the ground. </li><li>Some plants produce seeds that need fire in order to germinate. </li><li>Many plants have thick underground stems that can survive fires. </li></ul><p>The densely growing trees make it difficult for very large animals to penetrate the chaparral, so most chaparral animals are small. They include insects, birds, reptiles, and rodents. The largest animals are deer, which browse on the leaves of chaparral trees.</p><h3>Deserts</h3><p>A <strong role="strong">desert</strong> is a biome that receives no more than 25 centimeters (10 inches) of precipitation per year. Deserts are found in both temperate and tropical areas. The largest deserts are found at about 30&deg; north or south latitude due to the dry air masses over these latitudes. Deserts also occur in rain shadows. A rain shadow is a dry region on the leeward side of a mountain range (see Lesson 16.1). Examples of rain shadow deserts include Death Valley and the Mojave Desert, both partly in California. The dry air in deserts leads to extreme temperature variations from day to night. Without water vapor in the air, there are no clouds to block sunlight during the day or hold in heat at night.</p><p>Desert soil is usually very poor. They tend to be sandy or rocky and lack organic content. Because of the low precipitation, minerals are not leached out and may become too concentrated for plants to tolerate. Plant cover is very sparse, so most of the soil is exposed and easily eroded by wind. The occasional rain tends to be brief but heavy, causing runoff and more erosion.</p><p>Most desert plants have evolved adaptations to the extreme dryness. For example:</p><ul><li>Many plants have special water-storing tissues in leaves, stems, or roots. </li><li>Some plants have very long taproots that can reach down to the water table. </li><li>Some plants have wide-spreading roots that can absorb water over a large area. </li><li>Plants may have small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. </li></ul><p>Most desert animals have adaptations to the extreme heat and bright sunlight. For example:</p><ul><li>Many small animals stay underground in burrows during the day and come out only at night. </li><li>Most animals that are active in daytime spend as much time as possible in the shade of rocks or plants. </li><li>Some animals have very large ears or other appendages, which help them lose heat to the environment, keeping them cooler. </li><li>Many animals are light in color, which helps them reflect sunlight and stay cooler. </li></ul><h3>Tropical Biomes</h3><p>Tropical biomes receive more sunlight than any other biomes on Earth. They also have high temperatures year-round. In addition to deserts, tropical biomes include forests and grasslands.</p><h4>Tropical Forests</h4><p>There are two types of tropical forests: tropical rainforests and tropical dry forests. Both occur near the equator, so they have plenty of sunlight and warmth year-round. However, they differ in the amount and timing of the precipitation they receive.</p><ul><li><strong role="strong">Tropical rainforests</strong> receive more precipitation than any other biome. They are found near the equator in Central and South America and Africa. The soil is thin and poor, partly because the lush plant growth uses up nutrients before they can accumulate in the soil. Biodiversity of animals as well as plants is greater than in all other biomes combined. Most plants are tall, broadleaf evergreen trees. They form a dense canopy over the forest, so little sunlight reaches the forest floor. The many vines and epiphytes reach sunlight by growing on trees. Numerous animal species also live in trees, including monkeys, sloths, and leopards. </li><li><strong role="strong">Tropical dry forests</strong> occur in tropical areas where most of the precipitation falls during a single wet season. As a result, there is a pronounced dry season. Tropical dry forests are found in parts of Central and South America, Africa, and India. Trees and other plants are widely spaced because there is not enough water for denser growth. The plants also have adaptations to help them cope with seasonal drought. For example, many go dormant during the dry season, which reduces their need for water. Animals that live in tropical dry forests include arboreal animals such as monkeys and ground-dwelling animals such as rodents.</li></ul><h4>Tropical Grasslands</h4><p><strong role="strong">Tropical grasslands</strong> are tropical biomes with relatively low rainfall where the primary producers are grasses. Tropical grasslands are found mainly in Africa, where they are called savannas. They have high temperatures year-round, but relatively low precipitation. Moreover, most of the precipitation falls during a single wet season, leaving the rest of the year very dry. The soil is also poor.</p><p>In addition to grasses, there are scattered clumps of trees in most tropical grasslands. The trees are drought-adapted species such as acacia, which have narrow leaves that reduce water loss. Acacia trees also have thorns that discourage browsing by herbivores. Africa savannas are well known for their huge herds of herbivores, including zebra, giraffe, and wildebeest. They are also well known for their large carnivores&mdash;such as lions, cheetahs, and hyenas&mdash;that prey on the herbivores.</p><h3>Lesson Summary</h3><p>The concept map below shows how the terrestrial biomes described in this lesson are related.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2874" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Concept-map-text" id="Concept-map-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.9 </p></div><p> </p><h3>Review Questions</h3><ol start><li>Identify the two types of tundra and where they are found.</li><li>Name two temperate biomes and the main type of plant found in each biome.</li><li>In which biome are you most likely to find grasses, zebras, and lions?</li><li>Assume a new species of lizard has been discovered in the northern hemisphere.
