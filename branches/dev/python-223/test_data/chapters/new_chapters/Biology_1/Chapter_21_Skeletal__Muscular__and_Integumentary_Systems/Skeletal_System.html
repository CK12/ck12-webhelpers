Can you imagine what you would look like without it?</p><p>You would be a wobbly pile of muscle and internal organs, maybe a little similar to the slug in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.1 <a href="#Bio36-01-fig" id="Bio36-01-text">below</a>. Not that you would really be able to see yourself anyway, due to the folds of skin that would droop over your eyes because of your lack of skull bones.  You could push the skin out of the way, if you could only move your arms!</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=3096" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio36-01-text" id="Bio36-01-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.1 <caption>Banana slugs ( spp.), unlike you, can live just fine without a bony skeleton. They can do so because they are relatively small and their food source (vegetation) is plentiful and tends not to run away from them. Slugs move by causing a wave-like motion in their foot, (the ventral (bottom) area of the slug that is in contact with the ground). Slugs and other gastropods also live in environments very different to humans environments. Just think of how a bony skeleton would be of limited use to a slug whose lifetime is spent under a log munching on rotting leaf litter.</caption></p></div><p> </p><h3>The Skeleton</h3><p>Humans are vertebrates, which are animals that have a vertebral column, or backbone. Invertebrates, like the banana slug in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.1 <a href="#Bio36-01-fig" id="Bio36-01-text">above</a>, do not have a vertebral column, and use a different mechanism than vertebrates to move about. The sturdy internal framework of bones and cartilage that is found inside vertebrates, including humans, is called an <strong role="strong">endoskeleton</strong>. The adult human skeleton consists of approximately 206 bones, some of which are named in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.2 <a href="#Bio36-01-02-fig" id="Bio36-01-02-text">below</a>. Cartilage, another component of the skeleton can also be seen in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.2 <a href="#Bio36-01-02-fig" id="Bio36-01-02-text">below</a>. <strong role="strong">Cartilage</strong> is a type of dense connective tissue that is made of tough protein fibers. The function of cartilage in the adult skeleton is to provide smooth surfaces for the movement of bones at a joint. A <strong role="strong">ligament</strong> is a band of tough, fibrous tissue that connects bones together. Ligaments are not very elastic and some even prevent the movement of certain bones.</p><p>The skeletons of babies and children have many more bones and more cartilage than adults have. As a child grows, these &ldquo;extra&rdquo; bones, such as the bones of the skull (cranium), and the sacrum (tailbone) fuse together, and cartilage gradually hardens to become bone tissue.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=3079" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio36-01-02-text" id="Bio36-01-02-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.2 <caption>The skeleton is the bone and cartilage scaffolding that supports the body, and allows it to move. Bones act as attachment points for the muscles and tendons that move the body. Bones are also important for protection. For example, your skull bones (cranium) protect your brain, and your ribcage protects your heart and lungs. Cartilage is the light-gray material that is found between some of the bones and also between the ribcage and sternum.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>The bones of the skeleton can be grouped in two divisions: the axial skeleton and appendicular skeleton. The <strong role="strong">axial skeleton</strong> includes the bones of the head, vertebral column, ribs and sternum, in the left portion of <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.3 <a href="#Bio36-01-03-fig" id="Bio36-01-03-text">below</a>. There are 80 bones in the axial skeleton. The <strong role="strong">appendicular skeleton</strong> includes the bones of the limbs (arms and legs) along with the scapula and the pelvis, and is shown at right in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.3 <a href="#Bio36-01-03-fig" id="Bio36-01-03-text">below</a>. There are approximately 126 bones in the appendicular skeleton. Limbs are connected to the rest of the skeleton by collections of bones called girdles. The pectoral girdle consists of the clavicle (collar bone) and scapula (shoulder blade). The pelvic girdle consists of two pelvic bones (hipbones) that form the pelvic girdle. The vertebral column attaches to the top of the pelvis; the femur of each leg attaches to the bottom. The humerus is joined to the pectoral girdle at a joint and is held in place by muscles and ligaments.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=3116" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio36-01-03-text" id="Bio36-01-03-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.3 <caption>The two divisions of the human skeleton. The bones of the axial skeleton are blue, and the bones of the appendicular skeleton are pink.</caption></p></div><p> </p><h3>Function and Structure of Bones</h3><p>Many people think of bones as dry, dead, and brittle, which is what you might think if you saw a preserved skeleton in a museum. The association of bones with death is illustrated by the sweets shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.4 <a href="#Bio361-04-fig" id="Bio361-04-text">below</a>. This is a common association because the calcium-rich bone tissue of a vertebrate is the last to decompose after the organism dies. However, the bones in your body are very much alive. They contain many tough protein fibers, are crisscrossed by blood vessels, and certain parts of your bones are metabolically active. Preserved laboratory skeletons are cleaned with chemicals that remove all organic matter from the bones, which leaves only the calcium-rich mineralized (hardened) bone tissue behind.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=3113" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio361-04-text" id="Bio361-04-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.4 <caption>Sugar skulls made to celebrate Dia de Los Muertos (Day of the Dead), a time (the 1 and 2 of November) during which the people of Mexico and some Latin American countries celebrate and honor the lives of the deceased, and celebrate the continuation of life.</caption></p></div><p> </p><h4>Functions of Bones</h4><p>As you read earlier in this lesson, your skeletal system is important for the proper functioning of your body. In addition to giving shape and form to the body, bones have many important functions.</p><p>The main functions of bones are:</p><ul><li>Structural Support of the Body: The skeleton supports the body against the pull of gravity. The large bones of the lower limbs support the trunk when standing. </li><li>Protection of Internal Organs: The skeleton provides a rigid frame work that supports and protects the soft organs of the body. The fused bones of the cranium surround the brain to make it less vulnerable to injury. Vertebrae surround and protect the spinal cord and bones of the rib cage help protect the heart and lungs. </li><li>Attachment of the Muscles: The skeleton provides attachment surfaces for muscles and tendons which together enable movement of the body. </li><li>Movement of the Body: Bones work together with muscles as simple mechanical lever systems to produce body movement. </li><li>Production of Blood Cells: The formation of blood cells takes place mostly in the interior (marrow) of certain types of bones. </li><li>Storage of Minerals: Bones contain more calcium than any other organ in the form of calcium salts such as calcium phosphate. Calcium is released by the bones when blood levels of calcium drop too low. Phosphorus is also stored in bones. </li></ul><h4>Structure of Bones</h4><p>Although bones vary greatly in size and shape, they all have certain structural similarities. Bones are organs.Recall that organs are made up of two or more types of tissues. The two main types of bone tissue are compact bone and spongy bone. <strong role="strong">Compact bone</strong> makes up the dense outer layer of bones. <strong role="strong">Spongy bone</strong> is lighter and less dense than compact bone, and is found toward the center of the bone. <strong role="strong">Periosteum</strong> (from <em>peri</em> = around, <em>osteo</em> = bone),is the tough, shiny, white membrane that covers all surfaces of bones except at the joint surfaces. Periosteum is composed of a layer of fibrous connective tissue and a layer of bone forming cells. These structures can be seen in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.5 <a href="#Bio361-05-fig" id="Bio361-05-text">below</a>.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=3086" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio361-05-text" id="Bio361-05-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.5 <caption>Structure of a typical bone. The components that make up bones can be seen here. Compact bone is the dense material that makes up the outer ring of the bone. Most bones of the limbs are long bones, including the bones of the fingers. The classification of long bone refers to the shape of the bone rather than to the size.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=3076" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio36-01-06-text" id="Bio36-01-06-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.6 <caption>The internal structure of a bone. Both compact and spongy bone can be seen.</caption></p></div><p> </p><h4>Compact Bone</h4><p>Just below the periosteum is the hard layer of compact bone tissue. It is so called due to its high density, and it accounts for about 80% of the total bone mass of an adult skeleton. Compact bone is extremely hard, and is made up of many cylinder-shaped units called <strong role="strong">osteons</strong>, or Haversian systems. Osteons act like strong pillars within the bone to give the bone strength and allow it to bear the weight of the attached muscles and withstand the stresses of movement. As you can see in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.6 <a href="#Bio36-01-06-fig" id="Bio36-01-06-text">above</a>, osteons are made up of rings of calcium salts and collagen fibers, called bone matrix. <strong role="strong">Bone matrix</strong> is a mixture of calcium salts, such as calcium phosphate and calcium hydroxide, and collagen fibers (a type of protein) which form hollow tubes that look similar to the rings on a tree. Each of these matrix tubes is a lamella, which means &ldquo;thin plate&rdquo; (plural: lamellae). The calcium salts form crystals that give bones great strength, but the crystals do not bend easily, and tend to shatter if stressed. Collagen fibers are tough and flexible. All collagen fibers within a single lamella are lined up in the same direction, which gives each lamella great strength. Overall, the protein-calcium crystal combination in the matrix allows bones to bend and twist without breaking easily. The collagen fibers also act as a scaffold for the laying down of new calcium salts.</p><p>In the center of each osteon is a <strong role="strong">Haversian canal</strong>. The canal serves as a passageway for blood vessels and nerves. Within each osteon, many bone cells called osteocytes are located. Osteocytes are found in little pockets called lacunae that are sandwiched between layers of bone matrix. You can see lamellae and osteocytes in their lacunae in <strong role="strong">Figure 7b</strong>. <strong role="strong">Osteocytes</strong> are responsible for monitoring the protein and mineral content of the bone and they direct the release of calcium into the blood and the uptake up of calcium salts into the bone. Other bone cells, called <strong role="strong">osteoblasts</strong> secrete the organic content of matrix, and are responsible for the growth of new bone. Osteoblasts are found near the surface of bones. <strong role="strong">Osteoclasts</strong> are bone cells that remove calcium salts from bone matrix. These bone cells will be discussed in further detail later in this lesson.  In the meantime, <strong role="strong">Table</strong>  1.1 <a href="#table:structure_function_of_bones-fig" id="table:structure_function_of_bones-text">below</a> describes some of the different structures and functions of bones.</p><div><p><strong>Table </strong>1.1 </p><table><p></p><thead><tr><td> </td><td>Function</td><td>Location</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong role="strong">Osteons (also known as Haversian systems)</strong></td><td>Act like pillars to give bone strength</td><td>Compact bone</td></tr><tr><td><strong role="strong">Bone matrix</strong></td><td>A mixture of calcium salts and collagen fibers which form hollow tubes that look similar to the rings on a tree</td><td>Compact bone, spongy bone</td></tr><tr><td><strong role="strong">Lamella</strong></td><td>Layers of bone matrix in which collagen fibers point in the opposite direction to the fibers of the lamellae to each side, offers great strength and flexibility</td><td>Are the &ldquo;tree rings&rdquo; of osteons</td></tr><tr><td><strong role="strong">Lacunae</strong></td><td>Location of osteocytes</td><td>Between lamellae of bone matrix</td></tr><tr><td><strong role="strong">Osteocytes</strong></td><td>Monitor the protein and mineral content of bone and direct the release of calcium into the blood; control the uptake up of calcium salts into the bone</td><td>Within lacunae of osteons</td></tr><tr><td><strong role="strong">Osteoblasts</strong></td><td>Bone-forming cell; secretes organic part of matrix (collagen)</td><td>Found near the surface of bones</td></tr><tr><td><strong role="strong">Osteoclasts</strong></td><td>Responsible for the breakdown of matrix and release of calcium salts into the blood.</td><td>Bone surfaces</td></tr><tr><td><strong role="strong">Chondrocyte</strong></td><td>Cartilage-forming cell</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><strong role="strong">Periosteum</strong></td><td>Contains pain receptors and is sensitive to pressure or stress; provides nourishment through a good the blood supply; provides an attachment for muscles and tendons</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><strong role="strong">Collagen fibers</strong></td><td>Tough protein fibers that give bones flexibility and prevent shattering.</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><strong role="strong">Calcium salts</strong></td><td>Form crystals that give bones great strength.</td><td> </td></tr></tbody></table></div><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=3087" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Biop36-01-07-text" id="Biop36-01-07-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.7 <caption>The location of Haversian canals and osteocytes in osteons of compact bone.</caption></p></div><p> </p><h4>Spongy Bone</h4><p>Spongy bone occurs at the ends of long bones and is less dense than compact bone. The term &ldquo;spongy&rdquo; refers only to the appearance of the bone, as spongy bone is quite strong. The lamellae of spongy bone form an open, porous network of bony branches, or beams called trabiculae, that give the bone strength and make the bone lighter. It also allows room for blood vessels and bone marrow. Spongy bone does not have osteons, instead nutrients reach the osteocytes of spongy bone by diffusion through tiny openings in the surface of the spongy bone. Spongy bone makes up the bulk of the interior of most bones, including the vertebrae.</p><h4>Bone Marrow</h4><p>Many bones also contain a soft connective tissue called <strong role="strong">bone marrow</strong>. There are two types of bone marrow: red marrow and yellow marrow. Red marrow produces red blood cells, platelets, and most of the white blood cells for the body. Yellow marrow produces white blood cells. The color of yellow marrow is due to the high number of fat cells it contains. Both types of bone marrow contain numerous blood vessels and capillaries. In newborns, bones contain only red marrow. As the child ages, red marrow is mostly replaced by yellow marrow. In adults, red marrow is mostly found in the flat bones of the skull, the ribs, the vertebrae and pelvic bones. It is also found between the spongy bone at the very top of the femur and the humerus.</p><h4>Periosteum</h4><p>The outer surfaces of bones&mdash;except where they make contact with other bones at joints&mdash;are covered by periosteum. Periosteum has a tough, external fibrous layer, and an internal layer that contains osteoblasts (the bone-growing cells). The periosteum is richly supplied with blood, lymph and nociceptors, which make it very sensitive to manipulation (recall that nociceptors are pain receptors that are also found in the skin and skeletal muscle). Periosteum provides nourishment to the bone through a rich blood supply. The periosteum is connected to the bone by strong collagen fibers called Sharpey's fibres, which extend into the outer lamellae of the compact bone.</p><h3>Bone Shapes</h3><p>The four main types of bones are long, short, flat, and irregular. The classification of a bone as being long, short, flat, or irregular is based on the shape of the bone rather than the size of the bone. For example, both small and large bones can be classified as long bones. There are also some bones that are embedded in tendons, these bones tend to be oval-shaped and are called sesamoid bones.</p><ul><li><strong role="strong">Long Bones:</strong> Bones that are longer than they are wide are called long bones. They consist of a long shaft with two bulky ends. Long bones are primarily made up of compact bone but may also have a large amount of spongy bone at both ends. Long bones include bones of the thigh (femur), leg (tibia and fibula), arm (humerus), forearm (ulna and radius), and fingers (phalanges). The classification refers to shape rather than the size. </li><li><strong role="strong">Short Bones:</strong> Short bones are roughly cube-shaped, and have only a thin layer of compact bone surrounding a spongy interior. The bones of the wrist (carpals) and ankle (tarsals) are short bones, as are the sesamoid bones (see below). </li><li><strong role="strong">Sesamoid Bones:</strong> Sesamoid bones are embedded in tendons. Since they act to hold the tendon further away from the joint, the angle of the tendon is increased and thus the force of the muscle is increased. An example of a sesamoid bone is the patella (kneecap). </li><li><strong role="strong">Flat Bones:</strong> Flat bones are thin and generally curved, with two parallel layers of compact bones sandwiching a layer of spongy bone. Most of the bones of the skull (cranium) are flat bones, as is the sternum (breastbone). </li><li><strong role="strong">Irregular Bones:</strong> Irregular bones are bones that do not fit into the above categories. They consist of thin layers of compact bone surrounding a spongy interior. As implied by the name, their shapes are irregular and complicated. The vertebrae and pelvis are irregular bones.</li></ul><p>All bones have surface markings and characteristics that make a specific bone unique. There are holes, depressions, smooth facets, lines, projections and other markings. These usually represent passageways for vessels and nerves, points of articulation with other bones or points of attachment for tendons and ligaments.</p><h3>Cellular Structure of Bone</h3><p>When blood calcium levels decrease below normal, calcium is released from the bones so that there will be an adequate supply for metabolic needs. When blood calcium levels are increased, the excess calcium is stored in the bone matrix. The dynamic process of releasing and storing calcium goes on almost continuously, and is carried out by different bone cells.</p><p>There are several types of bone cells.</p><ul><li><strong role="strong">Osteoblasts</strong> are bone-forming cells which are located on the inner and outer surfaces of bones. They make a collagen-rich protein mixture (called osteoid), which mineralizes to become bone matrix. Osteoblasts are immature bone cells. Osteoblasts that become trapped in the bone matrix differentiate into osteocytes. The osteocytes stop making osteoid and instead direct the release of calcium from the bones and the uptake of calcium from the blood. </li><li><strong role="strong">Osteocytes</strong> originate from osteoblasts which have migrated into and become trapped and surrounded by bone matrix which they themselves produce. The spaces which they occupy are known as lacunae. Osteocytes are star-shaped, and they have many processes which reach out to meet osteoblasts probably for the purposes of communication. Their functions include matrix maintenance and calcium homeostasis. They are mature bone cells. Refer to <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.7 <a href="#Biop36-01-07-fig" id="Biop36-01-07-text">above</a> for the location of osteocytes. </li><li><strong role="strong">Osteoclasts</strong> are the cells responsible for bone <strong role="strong">resorption</strong>, which is the remodeling of bone to reduce its volume (see below). Osteoclasts are large cells with many nuclei, and are located on bone surfaces. They secrete acids which dissolve the calcium salts of the matrix, releasing them into the blood stream. This causes the calcium and phosphate concentration of the blood to increase. Osteoclasts constantly remove minerals from the bone, and osteoblasts constantly produce matrix that binds minerals into the bone, so both of these cells are important in calcium homeostasis.</li></ul><h3>Bone Cells and Calcium Homeostasis</h3><p>Remodeling or bone turnover is the process of resorption of minerals followed by replacement by bone matrix which causes little overall change in the shape of the bone. This process occurs throughout a person's life. Osteoblasts and osteoclasts communicate with each other for this purpose. The purpose of remodeling is to regulate calcium homeostasis, repair micro-damaged bones (from everyday stress), and also to shape the skeleton during skeletal growth.</p><p>The process of bone resorption by the osteoclasts releases stored calcium into the systemic circulation and is an important process in regulating calcium balance. As bone formation actively fixes circulating calcium in its mineral form, removing it from the bloodstream, resorption actively unfixes it thereby increasing circulating calcium levels. These processes occur in tandem at site-specific locations.</p><h3>Development of Bones</h3><p>The terms osteogenesis and ossification are often used to indicate the process of bone formation. The skeleton begins to form early in fetal development. By the end of the eighth week after conception, the skeletal pattern is formed by cartilage and connective tissue membranes. At this point, ossification begins.</p><p>Early in fetal development, the skeleton is made of cartilage. Cartilage is a type of dense connective tissue that is composed of collagen fibers and/or elastin fibers, and cells called chondrocytes which are all set in a gel-like substance called matrix. Cartilage does not contain any blood vessels so nutrients diffuse through the matrix to the chondrocytes. Cartilage serves several functions, including providing a framework upon which bone deposition can begin and supplying smooth surfaces for the movement of bones at a joint, such as the cartilage shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.8 <a href="#Bio361-08-fig" id="Bio361-08-text">below</a>.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=3097" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio361-08-text" id="Bio361-08-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.8 <caption>A micrograph of the structure of hyaline cartilage, the type of cartilage that is found in the fetal skeleton and at the ends of mature bones.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>The bones of the body gradually form and harden throughout the remaining gestation period and for years after birth in a process called <strong role="strong">endochondrial ossification</strong>. However, not all parts of the fetal cartilage are replaced by bone, cartilage remains in many places in the body including the joints, the rib cage, the ear, the tip of the nose, the bronchial tubes and the little discs between the vertebrae.</p><h3>Endochondral Ossification</h3><p>Endochondral ossification is the process of replacing cartilage with bony tissue, as shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.9 <a href="#Bio361-09-fig" id="Bio361-09-text">below</a>. Most of the bones of the skeleton are formed in this way. During the third month after conception, blood vessels form and grow into the cartilage, and transport osteoblasts and stem cells into the interior which change the cartilage into bone tissue. The osteoblasts form a bone collar of compact bone around the central shaft (diaphysis) of the bone. Osteoclasts remove material from the center of the bone, and form the central cavity of the long bones. Ossification continues from the center of the bone toward the ends of the bones.</p><p>The cartilage at the ends of long bones (the epiphyses) continues to grow so the developing bone increases in length. Later, usually after birth, secondary ossification centers form in the epiphyses, as shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.9 <a href="#Bio361-09-fig" id="Bio361-09-text">below</a>. Ossification in the epiphyses is similar to that in the center of the bone except that the spongy bone is kept instead of being broken down to form a cavity. When secondary ossification is complete, the cartilage is totally replaced by bone except in two areas. A region of cartilage remains over the surface of the epiphysis as articular cartilage and another area of cartilage remains inside the bone at either end. This area is called the <strong role="strong">epiphyseal plate</strong> or growth region.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=3107" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio361-09-text" id="Bio361-09-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.9 <caption>The process of endochondrial ossification which happens when the skeleton is developing during fetal development, and in childhood.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>When a bone develops from a fibrous membrane, the process is called <strong role="strong">intramembranous ossification</strong>. Intramembranous ossification usually happens in flat bones such as the cranial bones and the clavicles. During intramembranous ossification in the developing fetus, the future bones are first formed as connective tissue membranes. Osteoblasts migrate to the membranes and secrete osteoid, which becomes mineralized and forms bony matrix. When the osteoblasts are surrounded by matrix they are called osteocytes. Eventually, a bone collar of compact bone develops and marrow develops inside the bone.</p><h4>Bone Elongation</h4><p>An infant is born with zones of cartilage, called epiphyseal plates, shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.10 <a href="#Bio36-01-10-fig" id="Bio36-01-10-text">below</a>, between segments of bone to allow further growth of the bone. When the child reaches skeletal maturity (between the ages of 18 and 25 years), all of the cartilage in the plate is replaced by bone, which stops further growth.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=3082" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio36-01-10-text" id="Bio36-01-10-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.10 <caption>Location of the epiphyseal plate in an immature long bone. The chondrocytes in the epiphyseal plate are very metabolically active, as they constantly reproduce by mitosis. As the older chondrocytes move away from the plate they are replaced by osteoblasts that mineralize this new area, and the bone lengthens.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>Bones grow in length at the epiphyseal plate by a process that is similar to endochondral ossification. The chondrocytes (cartilage cells) in the region of the epiphyseal plate grow by mitosis and push older chondrocytes down toward the bone shaft (diaphysis). Eventually these chondrocytes age and die. Osteoblasts move into this region and replace the chondrocytes with bone matrix. This process lengthens the bone and continues throughout childhood and the adolescent years until the cartilage growth slows down and finally stops. When cartilage growth stops, usually in the early twenties, the epiphyseal plate completely ossifies so that only a thin epiphyseal line remains and the bones can no longer grow in length. Bone growth is under the influence of growth hormone from the anterior pituitary gland and sex hormones from the ovaries and testes.</p><p>Even though bones stop growing in length in early adulthood, they can continue to increase in thickness or diameter throughout life in response to stress from increased muscle activity or to weight-bearing exercise.</p><h3>Joints</h3><p>A <strong role="strong">joint</strong> (also called an articulation), is a point at which two or more bones make contact. They are constructed to allow movement and provide mechanical support for the body. Joints are a type of lever, which is a rigid object that is used to increase the mechanical force that can be applied to another object. This reduces the amount of energy that need to be spent in moving the body around. The articular surfaces of bones, which are the surfaces that meet at joints, are covered with a smooth layer of articular cartilage.</p><p>There are three types of joints: immovable, partly movable, and synovial. See <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOMFX_83sqk&amp;feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOMFX_83sqk&amp;#38;feature=related</a> for a brief overview of the types of joints.</p><ul><li><strong role="strong">Immovable Joint</strong>: At an immovable joint (or a fixed joint), bones are connected by dense connective tissue, which is usually collagen. Immovable joints, like those connecting the cranial bones, have edges that tightly interlock, and do not allow movement.

Cartilaginous joints allow more movement between bones than a fibrous joint does, but much less than the highly mobile synovial joint.

They are also the most common type of joint in the body. Synovial joints contain a space between the bones of the joint (the articulating bones), which is filled with synovial fluid. <strong role="strong">Synovial fluid</strong> is a thick, stringy fluid that has the consistency of egg albumin. The word "synovial" comes from the Latin word for "egg". The fluid reduces friction between the articular cartilage and other tissues in joints and lubricates and cushions them during movement. There are many different types of synovial joints, and many different examples. A synovial joint is shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.12 <a href="#Bio36-01-12-fig" id="Bio36-01-12-text">below</a>.</li></ul><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=3093" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio36-01-12-text" id="Bio36-01-12-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.12 <caption>Diagram of a synovial joint.

The inner surface (the synovial membrane) has cells producing synovial fluid that lubricates the joint and prevents the two cartilage caps on the bones from rubbing together. Some joints also have tendons which are bands of connective tissue that link muscles to bones. Bursae are small sacs filled with synovial fluid that reduce friction in the joint. The knee joint contains 13 bursae. Synovial joints can be classified by the degree of mobility they allow, as shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.13 <a href="#Bio36-01-13-fig" id="Bio36-01-13-text">below</a>.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=3083" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio36-01-13-text" id="Bio36-01-13-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.13 <caption>Types of Synovial joints.

The ball-and-socket joint consists of one bone that is rounded and that fits within a cuplike bone. Examples of a ball and socket joint include the hip (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.14 <a href="#Bio361-15-fig" id="Bio361-15-text">below</a>) and shoulder.</p><p>In an ellipsoidal joint an ovoid articular surface, fits into an elliptical cavity in such a way as to permit of some back and forth movement, but not side-to-side motion.

The movements at a saddle joint are the same as in an ellipsoid joint. The best example of this form is the joint between the carpals and metacarpals of the thumb.</p><p>In the hinge joint, the articular surfaces fit together in such a way as to permit motion only in one plane, forward and backward, the extent of motion at the same time being considerable. An example of a hinge joint is the elbow.</p><p>The pivot joint is formed by a process that rotates within a ring, the ring being formed partly of bone, and partly of ligament. An example of a pivot joint is the joint between the radius and ulna that allows you to turn the palm of your hand up and down.</p><p>A gliding joint, also known as a plane joint, is a joint which allows one bone to slide over another, such as between the carpels of the fingers. Gliding joints are also found in your wrists and ankles.</p><p>Not all bones are interconnected directly: There are 6 bones in the middle ear called the ossicles (three on each side) that articulate only with each other. The hyoid bone which is located in the neck and serves as the point of attachment for the tongue, does not articulate with any other bones in the body, being supported by muscles and ligaments. The longest and heaviest bone in the body is the femur and the smallest is the stapes bone in the middle ear. In an adult, the skeleton makes up around 20% of the total body weight.</p><h3>Homeostatic Imbalances of Bone</h3><p>Despite their great strength, bones can <strong role="strong">fracture</strong>, or break. Fractures can occur at different places on a bone, and are usually due to excessive bending stress on the bone. Fractures can be complete in which the bone is completely broken, or incomplete in which the bone is cracked or chipped, but not broken all the way, as shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.16 <a href="#Bio361-16-fig" id="Bio361-16-text">below</a>. Immediately after a fracture, blood vessels that were torn leak blood into surrounding tissues and a mass of clotted blood, called a hematoma, forms. The area becomes swollen and sore. Within a few days capillaries begin to grow into the hematoma and white blood cells clean up the dead and dying cells. Fibroblasts and osteoblasts arrive and begin to rebuild the bone. Fibroblasts produce collagen fibers which span the area of the break and connect the ends of the broken bone together. Osteoblasts begin to form spongy bone, and chondroblasts form cartilage matrix. Later, the cartilage and spongy bone are replaced by a bony growth called a callus which forms about 3 to 4 weeks after the fracture, and continues until the break is firmly sealed 2 to 3 months later. Eventually the bony callus is replaced by spongy and compact bone, similar to the rest of the bone.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=3102" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio361-16-text" id="Bio361-16-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.16 </p></div><p> </p><p><strong role="strong">Rickets</strong> is a softening of the bones in children which potentially leads to fractures and deformity; bowing of the leg bones is shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.17 <a href="#Bio361-17-fig" id="Bio361-17-text">below</a>. Rickets is among the most frequent childhood diseases in many developing countries. The most common cause is a vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D is needed by the body to absorb calcium from foods and to form bones. However, lack of calcium in the diet may also cause rickets. Although it can occur in adults, most cases of rickets occur in children who suffer from severe malnutrition, which usually results from starvation during early childhood. Osteomalacia is the term used to describe a similar condition occurring in adults, generally due to a deficiency of vitamin D. Osteomalacia can result in bone pain, difficulty in putting weight on bones, and sometimes fractures.</p><p>Some studies show most people get enough Vitamin D through their food and exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation in sunlight. Vitamin D is produced by certain skin cells from a compound found inside the cells. The skin cells need UV light for this reaction to happen. However, eating foods to which vitamin D has been added or taking a dietary supplement pill is usually preferred to UV exposure, due to the increased risk of sun burn and skin cancer. Many countries have fortified certain foods such as milk, bread, and breakfast cereals with Vitamin D to help prevent deficiency.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=3089" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio361-17-text" id="Bio361-17-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.17 <caption>An X ray image of a 2-year-old who shows the typical bowing of the femurs that occurs in rickets.

This results in bone mass that is greatly decreased, causing bones to become lighter and more porous. Bones are then more prone to breakage, especially the vertebrae and femurs. Compression fractures of the vertebrae and hip breaks, in which the top (or head) of the femur breaks are common, and can lead to further immobility, making the disease worse. Osteoporosis mostly occurs in older women and is linked to the decrease in production of sex hormones. However, poor nutrition, especially diets that are low in calcium and vitamin D, increase the risk of osteoporosis in later life. One of the easiest ways to prevent osteoporosis is to eat a healthful diet that has adequate calcium and vitamin D.

One of the leading reasons for hip replacement is osteoarthritis of the joint in which the cartilage around the top of the femur bone deteriorates over time, and causes the bones of the joint to grind painfully against each other.

Decreased movement of the joint because of the pain may lead to muscles that are attached to the joint to become weaker, and ligaments may become looser. Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis. Some of the most common causes include old age, sport injuries to the joint, bone fractures, and overweight and obesity.

Functions of bones include support, protection, movement, mineral storage, and formation of blood cells. </li><li>The adult human skeleton usually consists of 206 named bones and these bones can be grouped in two divisions: axial skeleton and appendicular skeleton. </li><li>There are two types of bone tissue: compact and spongy. Compact bone consists of closely packed osteons, or Haversian systems. Spongy bone consists of plates of bone, called trabeculae, around irregular spaces that contain red bone marrow. </li><li>Osteogenesis is the process of bone formation. Three types of cells, osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts, are involved in bone formation and remodeling. </li><li>In intramembranous ossification, connective tissue membranes are replaced by bone. This process occurs in the flat bones of the skull. In endochondral ossification, bone tissue replaces hyaline cartilage models. Most bones are formed in this manner. </li><li>Bones grow in length at the epiphyseal plate between the diaphysis and the epiphysis. When the epiphyseal plate completely ossifies, bones no longer increase in length. </li><li>Bones may be classified as long, short, flat, or irregular. The diaphysis of a long bone is the central shaft. There is an epiphysis at each end of the diaphysis. </li><li>There are three types of joints in terms of the amount of movement they allow: immovable, partly movable, and synovial joints (which are freely movable). </li></ul><h3>Review Questions</h3><ol start><li>Identify an example of a cell, a tissue, and an organ of the skeletal system.</li><li>Identify the main bones of the axial skeleton.</li><li>Identify the main bones of the appendicular skeleton.</li><li>List four functions of bones and the skeleton.</li><li>What is endochondrial ossification, and when does it occur?</li><li>Name the three main types of joints, and identify a location in the body that is an example of that type of joint.</li><li>Outline how a bone fracture is repaired.</li><li>What is the purpose of Haversian canals?</li><li>Leukemia is a type of cancer that affects bone.
