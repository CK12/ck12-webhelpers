<h2>Lesson 1.2: Communicating Ideas</h2><h3>Lesson Objectives</h3><ul><li>Outline the need for scientists to be able to share their ideas and findings with each other. </li><li>Identify the role of graphics in presenting results of an investigation. </li><li>Identify the role of peer review in the communication of ideas. </li><li>Examine how ethics are applied to communicating ideas and research. </li><li>Compare scientist to scientist communication to scientist to public communication. </li><li>Identify the benefits of studying science, even if you do not intend on becoming a scientist. </li><li>List three things that can influence scientific research. </li><li>Identify two ways that biotechnology has affected our lives. </li></ul><h3><strong role="strong">Introduction</strong></h3><p>The reliability of scientific knowledge comes partly from the objectivity of scientific methods, and also from scientists discussing ideas with each other. In talking with each other, researchers must use more than just their scientific understanding of the world. They must also be able to convince a community of their peers of the correctness of their concepts and ideas.</p><h3>Scientist to Scientist Communication</h3><p>A wide range of scientific literature is published and it is a format where scientific debates are properly carried out and reviewed. This includes scientific publications that report original research within a scientific field and can comprise of the following:</p><ul><li>scientific articles published in scientific journals </li><li>books written by one or a small number of co-authors who are researchers </li><li>presentations at academic conferences, especially those organized by societies (for example, the American Association for the Advancement of Science) </li><li>government reports </li><li>scientific publications on the internet </li><li>books, technical reports, pamphlets, and working papers issued by individual researchers or research organizations </li></ul><p><strong role="strong">Scientific journals</strong> communicate and document the results of research carried out in universities and various other research institutions. They are like a type of magazine that contains many articles which are written by different researchers about their ideas and discoveries. Most scientific journals cover a single scientific field and publish the research within that field; the research is normally expressed in the form of a scientific paper.</p><p>An <strong role="strong">academic conference</strong> is a conference for researchers (not always academics) to present and discuss their work. Together with scientific journals, conferences are an important channel for exchange of ideas between researchers. Generally, work is shared in the form of visual posters or short presentations lasting about 10 to 30 minutes. These are usually followed by discussion. A researcher is presenting his work to his peers in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.12 <a href="#Bio12-01-fig" id="Bio12-01-text">below</a>.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2458" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio12-01-text" id="Bio12-01-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.12 <caption>A presentation at an academic conference. At conferences, scientists are able to share ideas and their research results with many people at one time, and can talk directly to other researchers and answer their questions.</caption></p></div><p> </p><h4>Types of Scientific Publications: Scientific Journals</h4><p>A scientific journal is a publication that reports new research, and sometimes contains general science news articles. Most journals are highly specialized for a particular field of research such as biochemistry, microbiology, or botany. However, some of the oldest journals such as <em>Nature</em> publish articles and scientific papers across a wide range of scientific fields. The journals shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.13 <a href="#Bio12-02-fig" id="Bio12-02-text">below</a> have a similar look and layout to science journals.</p><p>Scientific journals contain articles that have been peer reviewed in an attempt to ensure that articles meet the journal's standards of quality, and scientific validity. A scientific journal is not usually read casually as you would read a magazine. Some of the content can be very dense and detailed.</p><p>The publication of the results of research is an essential part of the scientific process. The researcher who has written the paper must give enough details about their experiments so that an independent researcher could repeat the experiment to verify the results.</p><p>The significance of these different parts of scientific literature differs between science disciplines and has changed over time. Peer-reviewed journal articles remain the most common publication type and have the highest level of trust. However, journals vary enormously in their prestige and importance, and the value of a published article depends on the journal, review process and the degree that it is referenced by other scientists.</p><p>Some well known and well respected science and medical journals include:</p><ul><li>Science </li><li>Nature </li><li>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) </li><li>Public Library of Science (PLoS) </li><li>Cell </li><li>Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) </li><li>The Lancet </li><li>Journal of Theoretical Biology </li></ul><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2446" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio12-02-text" id="Bio12-02-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.13 <caption>These research journals publish research papers written by economists, people who study the economy, and related issues. However, the layout of research journals is very similar.</caption></p></div><p> </p><h4>Science Articles</h4><p>New research is usually written up in the form of a <strong role="strong">scientific article</strong>, which often appear in journals. A scientific article has a standardized structure, which varies only slightly between the different sciences. This format can also be used for your lab reports as part of this class.</p><p>It is not really the format of the article that is important, but what lies behind it or the content. However, several key format requirements need to be met by every science article:</p><p>1. The title should be short and indicate the contents of the article.</p><p>2. The names of all authors that were involved in the research should be given. Where the authors work or study should also be listed.</p><p>3. The first section is normally an <strong role="strong">abstract</strong>: a one-paragraph summary of the work. The abstract is intended to serve as a quick guide for the reader as to the content of the article.</p><p>4. The format should be able to be stored in a library so that scientists years later will be able to recover any document in order to study and assess it</p><p>5. The content of the study should be presented in the context of previous scientific investigations, by citing related documents in the existing literature. This is usually in a section called an <strong role="strong">introduction</strong>.</p><p>6. Observations that were made, and measurements that were taken are described in a section usually called <strong role="strong">Materials and Methods</strong>. The experiments should be described in such a way that other scientists in the same or related fields can repeat the experiments and observations and know whether he or she gets the same results. This is called <strong role="strong">reproducibility</strong>.</p><p>7. Similarly, the results of the investigation are given in a section called, <strong role="strong">results</strong>. Data should be presented in tabular or graphic form (images, charts, graphs, photos, or diagrams, shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.14 <a href="#BioI-01-02-03-fig" id="BioI-01-02-03-text">below</a>. Graphics should have a caption to explain what they are showing.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2438" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#BioI-01-02-03-text" id="BioI-01-02-03-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.14 <caption>Examples of a graph and a chart that can be used to communicate data in scientific papers.

Graphics help to illustrate ideas that would otherwise be too confusing to describe in words only.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>8. Interpretation of the meaning of the results is usually addressed in a <strong role="strong">discussion</strong> and/or <strong role="strong">conclusion</strong> section. The conclusions drawn should be based on previous studies and/or new scientific results. They should also be written in a way such that any reader with knowledge of the field can follow the argument and confirm that the conclusions are sound.</p><p>9. Finally, a <strong role="strong">references</strong> or <strong role="strong">literature cited</strong> section lists the sources cited by the authors in the format required by the journal.</p><h4>Sources of Information</h4><p>The reliability of information is dependent on whether the information appears in a primary source, secondary source, or a tertiary source.</p><p>Most research studies are first published in a scientific journal, which are referred to as <strong role="strong">primary sources</strong>. Technical reports, for minor research results are also primary sources.</p><p><strong role="strong">Secondary sources</strong> include articles in review journals (collections of recent research articles on a topic). Review journals are usually published to highlight advances and new lines of research in specific areas, such as human genetics, specific medical disorders (such as heart disease), neurology (the study of the nervous system) or malacology, (the study of snails and other mollusks). Large projects, broad arguments, or a mix of different types of articles may appear in a book. Review journals and books are referred to as secondary sources. Tertiary sources might include encyclopedias and news articles which are generally written for the public to read.</p><h4>Peer Review</h4><p>Scientists are expected to report their work truthfully and honestly. They are also expected to have their work reviewed by fellow scientists. This process is called peer review.</p><p><strong role="strong">Peer review</strong> is a process of opening a scientist&rsquo;s research or ideas (in the form of a scientific paper) to examination by other scientists who are experts in the same field. The peer review process aims to make authors meet the standards of their area of study, and to meet the expected standards of science in general. Publications that have not undergone peer review are likely to be regarded with suspicion by scholars and professionals in many fields. However, even peer reviewed journals can contain errors.</p><p>A reason for the need for peer review is that it is rare for an individual author or research team to spot every mistake or flaw in a complicated piece of work. The review process provides an opportunity for improvement because a person with special expertise or experience reads the research paper before it is published. Typically, for publication in a science journal, it is also a requirement that the research is new and useful. Since reviewers are normally selected from experts in the areas of science covered by the article, the process of peer review is considered vital to establishing a reliable body of research and knowledge. Therefore, showing work to other scientists increases the likelihood that weaknesses will be found and corrected.</p><p>The process of peer review is not designed to detect fraud. As a result, there is usually a large scandal when a researcher and author of a science paper is found to have falsified the research in an article, as many other researchers may have relied upon their original research for their own work or the researcher could have received grant money based on falsified research. Peer review of scientific work assumes that the article reviewed has been honestly written. Usually reviewers do not have full access to the data from which the paper has been written, so they trust that the author is being truthful and honest.</p><h4>Research Bias</h4><p>It is important for the researcher to remain neutral or objective when conducting scientific research. A <strong role="strong">bias</strong> is a position for favoring one particular point of view over another, and it is usually based on preconceived ideas about a situation. The inability of a human being to remain completely objective is the source of such bias in research. Nevertheless, a researcher or their study is generally said to be <em>biased</em> only if the researcher&rsquo;s judgment is influenced by the biases they hold, which could influence their research results.</p><p>For example, you want to test whether your dog, Frankie, prefers his regular food or the super expensive brand dog food that you have just bought on sale. You would put each food in a bowl and offer both foods to Frankie at his meal time. However, you secretly hope he prefers his regular food because it is half the price of the more expensive food and you can buy it in the store down the road. Frankie takes a couple of mouthfuls of his regular food, but gobbles up all of the expensive food. You may think, &ldquo;Well, he did eat some of regular food, so he still likes it,&rdquo; when in fact Frankie clearly preferred the expensive brand. You buy the regular food anyhow. Whether you like it or not, you are biased toward the regular dog food.</p><p>This example above is greatly simplified, but, illustrates how personal opinions may influence an investigation.</p><p>Another type of bias, called a <em>systematic bias</em> is introduced from a flaw in measurements. For example, an incorrectly calibrated thermostat may consistently read several degrees hotter or colder than actual temperature. As a consequence, systematic bias commonly leads to systematic errors in the results of an investigation. Peer review can usually detect systematic biases in a research study.</p><h4>Conflict of Interest</h4><p>A <strong role="strong">conflict of interest</strong> is a situation in which a researcher has professional or personal interests that are at odds with each other. For example, a researcher is about to investigate a new headache medicine from a drug company called Tinneas. The researcher carries out experiments and finds that the medicine works very well. End of story, right? Not exactly.</p><p>Later it is discovered that the researcher owns Tinneas stock. This means he owns part of the company. Even if everything was done correctly during the experiment, and the drug really does work, this researcher has a conflict of interest. As an owner of the company, he will earn money if the drug works, but will lose money if the drug does not work. Therefore, any scientist that may have a reason to favor one particular result from an investigation should not be involved in that investigation.</p><p>Competing interests can make it difficult for a person to carry out his or her duties without bias. A conflict of interest exists even if no wrong has been done, or nothing results from it. A conflict of interest can affect the public confidence in the person, a profession, or company.</p><h4>Scientific Misconduct</h4><p>When presenting their research to others, an ethical scientist would not falsify results, lie about their results, or plagiarize (steal other peoples ideas or work).</p><p><strong role="strong">Scientific misconduct</strong> is the violation of these standard codes of scholarly conduct and ethical behavior in professional scientific research. Scientific misconduct may take place simply out of reputation. For example, academic scientists are often under enormous pressure to produce publications in peer reviewed journals. Alternatively, there may be commercial or political motivations where the financial or political success of a project depends on publishing evidence of a procedure working or not working. The consequences of scientific misconduct can be severe at a personal and professional level for the people involved. In addition, there are public health concerns attached to the promotion of medical or other procedures that are founded on doubtful research results.</p><h4>Truth and Honesty in Research and Communication</h4><p>Some instances of scientific fraud and scientific misconduct have gone through review and were detected only after other groups tried and failed to replicate the published results. An example is the case of physicist Jan Hendrik Sch&ouml;n, in which a total of fifteen papers on microelectronics and nanotechnology were accepted for publication in the top ranked journals, <em>Nature</em> and <em>Science</em>, following the usual peer review process. All fifteen were found to be fraudulent and were then withdrawn. The fraud was found, not by the peer review process, but by other research groups who tried and failed to reproduce the results of the paper.</p><p>Likewise, biomedical scientist Hwang Woo-Suk, rose to fame after claiming a series of breakthroughs in the field of stem cell research. He was once considered one of the pioneering experts in the field of stem cell research, because of his success in creating cloned human embryonic stem cells. However, his two most famous research articles on the cloning experiments were found to contain large amounts of fabricated data. Hwang&rsquo;s papers were retracted (withdrawn from publication), he lost his job at the university where he worked, and also lost his research funding.</p><h3>Scientist to Public Communication</h3><p>Science has become such a part of modern life that it is necessary to communicate the achievements, news, and ambitions of scientists to a wider audience. Scientists need to be able to tell each other and the public about their research and the results of their research. These two groups make up two very different audiences for scientists, however. The first audience is made up of their peers-fellow scientists who have an advanced understand of the technical language and procedures that are involved in scientific investigations. The second audience is made up of members of the public who may or may not understand or know about their research. For example, the following passage is a summary of a paper that appears in the Public Library of Science (PLoS), an online science journal:</p><p>A systematic analysis of Alzheimer disease amyloid &beta; peptide variants in <em>Drosophila</em> brain demonstrates that their predicted propensity to form protofibrillar aggregates correlates best with toxicity.</p><p>Biologists would have no problem understanding the language in this paragraph. However, to a person who is not familiar with this type of science, it may be interpreted as gibberish. In this, lies the challenge for scientists to communicate their research in a way that the general public can understand.</p><p>The results of the study could be written in the following way so that a general reader could follow what the researchers meant:</p><p>Studies of a particular type of brain protein, called amyloid &beta; peptides, have shown that they can sometimes change into a defective form that resembles sticky clumps. These clumps may become toxic and contribute to Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, a wasting disease of the brain. Researchers are examining these proteins to find out what exactly causes them to form such clumps. The studies were carried out on fruit flies, which are commonly used as animal models for genetic and biochemical studies of humans.</p><h4>Communicating to the Public Through the Internet</h4><p>Many scientists do a good job of presenting their work in an accessible way on the Internet. Scientists and science journalists write news articles that explain the research in everyday language, and can show how the research relates to the reader and to their environment. For example, who would want to read an article that only talked about research that is taking place at the South Pole? An article packed with numbers, units, and percentage rates would be pretty boring to read if it were not related to other areas such the environment, people, animals, or the climate. Also, presenting such academic subjects in a readable and engaging way, allows people to understand what research is being done and why. Such general presentation of science appeals to people because it allows the reader to relate the subject to their life and experiences. For example, both the National Science Foundation (NSF) U.S Antarctic Program and the International Polar Year (IPY) 2007-2008 have websites that explain the types of research that is going on in Antarctica and the Arctic. An NSF research vessel that is taking part in the IPY 2007-2008 is shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.15 <a href="#Bio12-04-fig" id="Bio12-04-text">below</a>.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2476" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio12-04-text" id="Bio12-04-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.15 <caption>Gentoo penguins watch the Research Vessel Laurence M. Gould in Antarctica.

Compare this to a scientific journal, which is written by and for scientific researchers. Science magazines are read by non-scientists and scientists who want accessible information on fields outside their specialization. Articles in science magazines are sometimes republished or summarized by the general press, in newspapers, online news sites, and blogs among other media forms.</p><p>Science magazines such as <em>New Scientist</em>, shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.16 <a href="#Bio12-05a-fig" id="Bio12-05a-text">below</a>, and <em>Scientific American</em>, have non-technical summaries of popular areas of research, notable discoveries, and scientific advancements in different fields of research. Science books engage the interest of many more people. So, too, do science websites and science television programming add more images and illustrations that help tell a story. In this way, more people can become more aware of how science effects their lives and become better informed about science subjects.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2474" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio12-05a-text" id="Bio12-05a-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.16 <caption>Cover of  magazine.</caption></p></div><p> </p><h3>Scientific Consensus</h3><p>You may have already heard the term <em>scientific consensus</em> being used when the subject of global warming is talked about in the news. <strong role="strong">Scientific consensus</strong> is the collective judgment, position, and opinion of a community of scientists in a particular field of science, at a particular time. Scientific consensus is not, by itself, a scientific argument, and is not part of the &ldquo;scientific method&rdquo;. But the topic for which a consensus exists may itself be based on both scientific arguments and scientific methods.</p><p>Consensus is normally carried out by scientists talking to each other and sharing their ideas and findings. Scientists can accomplish consensus by giving talks or presentations at conferences, or by publishing their ideas and findings for other scientists to read. This can lead to a situation where those within the field of science can recognize a consensus when it exists, but communicating that to others, such as non-scientists or the public, can be difficult. Sometimes, scientific institutes release statements that are meant to communicate a summary of the science from the inside to the outside. In cases where there is little controversy regarding the subject under study, laying out what the consensus is about can be straightforward.</p><p>Nevertheless, scientific consensus may be used in popular or political debate on subjects such as evolution or climate change that are controversial within the public sphere, but are not controversial within the scientific community.</p><h3>Science and Society</h3><p>Biology literally means "the study of life," and it is also a science that is very close to our everyday lives. Biology is a very broad field, covering the intricate workings of chemical processes inside our cells, to the more broad concepts of ecosystems and global climate change. Biologists study minute details of the human brain, the make up of our genes, and even the functioning of our reproductive system. For example, biologists recently finished decoding the human genome, the sequence of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) bases that may determine much of our abilities and predispositions for certain illnesses and can also play a major role in many court cases. For example, criminals have been caught, victims identified, and wrongly imprisoned people have been freed based on DNA evidence.</p><p>We are blitzed with headlines about possible health risks from certain foods as well as possible benefits of eating other foods. Commercials try to sell us the latest &ldquo;miracle&rdquo; pill for easy, fast weight loss. Many people are turning to herbal remedies to ease arthritis pain, improve memory, as well as improve their mood. Other people may choose the conventional medicines that can be bought at the pharmacist. It is important to know the effects such supplements, such as the ones shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.17 <a href="#Bio12-n2-fig" id="Bio12-n2-text">below</a>, and medicines can have on the body.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2492" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio12-n2-text" id="Bio12-n2-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.17 <caption>Nutritional supplements. Understanding how your body works and how nutrients work will help you decide whether you need to take a nutritional supplement. It will also help you make sense of the large amount of information available about regular medicines, if and when you need to take them.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>Can a biology book give you the answers to these everyday questions? No, but it will enable you learn how to sift through the biases of investigators, the press, and others in a quest to critically evaluate the question. To be honest, five years after you are finished with this biology book, it is doubtful you would remember all the details of metabolism. However, you will have a better idea about where to look for the answer. Knowing about the process of science will also allow you to make a more informed decision. Will you be a scientist? Yes, in a way. You may not be formally trained as a scientist, but you will be able to think critically, solve problems, have some idea about what science can and cannot do, as well as an understanding of the role of biology in your everyday life.</p><h4>Biology and You</h4><p>So why should you study biology? Because you are surrounded by it every day! It is about what happens in your brain as your read the words on this page and about how hippopotamuses know to come up to the surface to breath even while sleeping. Biology is about why a person with hook worms doesn't sneeze as much and about why Velcro works. From understanding the benefits of the vitamin-enriched milk or juice you that have at breakfast, to discerning commercials that promise smoother thighs or a fuller head of hair, or snack foods that announce they are the &ldquo;health busy livelier option for your," you cannot be fully informed about such claims unless you understand the science behind them, or can think like a scientist to analyze them. For example, you would need to know the types of fats you need to get from your food to know why eating salmon, shown in <strong role="strong">Figure 7</strong>  1.18 <a href="#Bio12-07-fig" id="Bio12-07-text">below</a>,<strong role="strong"> or other foods such as flax seeds and kiwifruit may be good for your health. </strong></p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2450" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio12-07-text" id="Bio12-07-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.18 <caption>Salmon has recently been touted as super-brain food, but do you know why it is so good for you? Educating yourself on how science affects your life is important. It will help you analyzing the validity of such claims, help you take better care of your health, be a wiser healthcare consumer, and make you more science literate in general.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>You may also become a stronger advocate for your community. For example, if a tree planting initiative has begun in your neighborhood, you can investigate the plan for your area and find out what you can do. You could then explain what the program is about to your friends and family.</p><p>Or, perhaps a city park has fallen into disrepair, and city officials are looking for feedback from the public about what to do with it. You could use scientific thinking to analyze the issue and options, and develop some solutions.</p><h4>What Is a Scientist?</h4><p>What exactly makes a person a &ldquo;scientist&rdquo; and what is their role in society? First, we should start with what scientists are not. They are not crazed geniuses with bad hair and a fondness for hysterical laughter, as <strong role="strong">Figure a</strong>  1.19 <a href="#Bio1-2-8-fig" id="Bio1-2-8-text">below</a> might suggest. Although they may not be on the cutting edge of fashion, they are regular people. They went to school like you, they studied math, reading, and science like you, and they probably exhibited at science fairs, just like the students in <strong role="strong">Figure b</strong>  1.19 <a href="#Bio1-2-8-fig" id="Bio1-2-8-text">below</a>.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2484" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio1-2-8-text" id="Bio1-2-8-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.19 <caption>Spot the Scientist. (a) An example of what scientists are not. (b) Real-life young scientists at an exhibition where they are presenting their research.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>Being a scientist does not require you to learn everything in this book or any other science book by heart, but understanding the important concepts really helps. Instead, being a scientist begins by <em>thinking</em> like a scientist. Scientists are curious about how the world works; they have many questions and go about answering those questions using the scientific methods, which we discussed in the <em>Nature of Science</em> lesson.</p><p>If you are fascinated by how things work and why they work a certain way, you too could become a scientist! <strong role="strong">Research scientists</strong> are the people that do the investigations and make the discoveries that you read or hear about. To work as a research scientist, a person usually needs an advanced degree in science. An advanced degree is obtained by attending graduate school after getting a Bachelor of Science, Engineering, or Arts degree. A Bachelor degree normally takes four years to complete; graduate degrees usually take two years for a Masters degree and four or more years to complete a Doctorate degree.</p><p>Scientific research offers much more to a person than just discovering new things. Researchers have the opportunity to meet with other people (scientists and non-scientists) who care about the same subjects that the scientists research such as cancer research, marine ecology, or human nutrition. Many researchers also teach students who will become the next generation of scientists. Scientists have many opportunities to work with different people, explore new fields, and broaden their expertise.</p><p>Scientists are part of a community that is based on ideals of trust and freedom, and their work can have a direct effect on society. As a result, the public usually has an interest in the results of research that will directly affect them. Therefore it is important that you can understand the meaning of a science story when you read it, see it, or hear about it and become an engaged and active member of the public when making decisions involving science.</p><h4>Science As a Human Endeavor</h4><p>Conducting science requires part human creativity and part scientific skepticism. Researchers make new observations and develop new ideas with the aim of describing the world more accurately or completely. These observations and ideas are often based on existing theories and observations that were made by earlier scientists.</p><p>For example, the history of molecular biology, the study of molecules that make up living things, is a good example of how scientific knowledge builds on earlier knowledge.</p><p>Researchers from chemistry and physics were involved in the early investigations to discover what was responsible for heredity. Scientists in the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> century knew that organisms inherited certain characteristics such as hair color from their parents. What we now call "genes" were then called &ldquo;units of heredity.&rdquo; Scientists did not know exactly how these heredity units were inherited or what they were made of, however. Following the development of the Mendelian theory of heredity in the 1910s and the development of atomic theory and quantum mechanics in the 1920s, such explanations seemed within reach. Researchers from chemistry and physics turned their attention to this biological question. Still, in the 1930s and 1940s it was not clear which, if any, area of research would be most successful.</p><p>In 1940, geneticists George Beadle and Edward Tatum demonstrated a relationship between genes and proteins. In 1944, physician and researcher Oswald Avery further elaborated on that finding by demonstrating that genes are made up of DNA. In 1952, geneticist Alfred Hershey and lab assistant Martha Chase confirmed that the genetic material of a virus that infects bacteria is made up of DNA. And in 1953, biologist James Watson and biophysicist Francis Crick, with the help of X-ray crystallographer Rosalind Franklin, worked out the three dimensional structure of DNA and built a model of the double helix structure of the molecule.</p><p>There have been many additional discoveries about DNA and heredity since then, which you will learn more about in the Molecular Genetics and Biotechnology chapters.</p><h4>Influences on Scientific Research</h4><p>To nonscientists, the competition, frustration, cooperation, and disagreement between research scientists can seem disorganized. Scientific knowledge develops from humans trying to figure things out. Scientific research and discoveries are carried out by people&mdash;people who have virtues, values, shortcomings, and limitations&mdash;just like everyone else. As a result, science and research can be influenced by the values of the society in which the research is carried out. How do such values influence research?</p><p>This question is of interest to more than just the scientific community. Science is becoming a larger part of everyone&rsquo;s life, from developing more effective medicines to designing innovative sustainable air conditioning systems that are modeled after the self-cooling nests of termites. The public has become more interested in learning more about the areas of science that affect everyday life. As a result, scientists have become more accountable to a society that expects to benefit from their work.</p><p>It costs money to carry out scientific studies. Things such as the cost of equipment, transportation, rent, and salaries for the people carrying out the research all need to be considered before a study can start. The systems of financial support for scientists and their work have been important influences of the type of research and the pace of how that research is conducted. Today, funding for research comes from many different sources, some of which include:</p><ul><li>Government, for example, through the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) </li><li>Military funding (such as through the Department of Defense) </li><li>Corporate sponsorship </li><li>Non-profit organizations, such as the American Cancer Society, Stroke Awareness For Everyone, Inc. (SAFE) </li><li>Private donors </li></ul><p>When the economy of a country slows down, the amount of money available for funding research is usually reduced, because both governments and businesses try to save money by cutting out on non-essential expenses.</p><p>Many pharmaceutical companies are heavily invested in research and development, on which they spend many millions of dollars every year. The companies aim to research and develop drugs that can be marketed and sold to treat certain illnesses, such as diabetes, cancer, or high blood pressure. Areas of research in which the companies do not see any hope of a return on their huge investments are not likely to be studied.</p><p>For example, two researchers, Evangelos Michelakis and Steven Archer of the University of Alberta, Canada, recently reported that a drug that has been used for in the treatment of rare metabolic disorders could be an effective drug for the treatment of several forms of cancer. Dichloroacetic acid, (DCA), is a chemical compound that appears to change the way cancer cells get energy, without affecting the function of normal cells. The researchers found that DCA killed cancer cells that were grown in the lab and reduced the size of tumors in rats.</p><p>However, DCA is non-patentable as a compound. A <strong role="strong">patent</strong> is a set of rights granted to a person or company (the patentee) for a certain period of time which allows the patentee the exclusive right to make, use, sell, or offer to sell the patented item. Because DCA cannot currently be patented, concerns are raised that without the financial security a patent would ensure, the financial incentive for the pharmaceutical industry to get involved in DCA-cancer research would be reduced, and therefore clinical trials of DCA may not be funded.</p><p>But, other sources of funding exist; previous studies of DCA have been funded by government organizations such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and by private charities such as the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Recognizing the possible challenges to funding, Dr. Michelakis's lab took the unusual step of directly asking for online donations to fund the research. After six months, his lab had raised over $800,000, which was enough to fund a small clinical study. Dr. Michelakis and Dr. Archer have nonetheless applied for a patent on the use of DCA in the treatment of cancer.</p><p>Funding for research can also be influenced by the public and by social issues. An intense amount of public interest was raised by the DCA study. The story received much media attention in early 2007. As a result, the American Cancer Society and other medical organizations received a large volume of public interest and questions regarding DCA. A few months later, the Department of Medicine of Alberta University reported that after the trial funding was secured, both the Alberta local ethics committee and Health Canada approved the first DCA Clinical Trial in Cancer.</p><p>Government funding of research can be indirectly influenced by the public. Funding priorities for specific research can be influenced by the ethical beliefs or reservations of elected public officials, or influenced by the public during constitutional amendment elections. Celebrities, often campaign to bring public attention to issues that are important to them. For example, Lance Armstrong, in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.20 <a href="#Bio12-09-fig" id="Bio12-09-text">below</a>, talks publicly about his experiences as a former cancer patient to help raise awareness about cancer research and the importance of funding for clinical trials.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2491" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio12-09-text" id="Bio12-09-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.20 <caption>Lance Armstrong, seven-time winner of the Tour de France, visited the NIH as part of the Tour of Hope, a week-long bicycle relay across the United States to raise awareness about cancer research and the importance of clinical trials.</caption></p></div><p> </p><h4>Science and Ethics</h4><p><strong role="strong">Ethics</strong>, also called moral philosophy, is the discipline concerned with what is morally good and bad, right and wrong. The term is also applied to any system or theory of moral values or principles. Personal ethics is the moral code that a person adheres to, while social ethics includes the moral theory that is applied to groups. Bioethics is the social ethics of biology and medicine; it deals with the ethical implications of biological research and applications, especially in medicine. Bioethicists are concerned with the ethical questions that arise in the relationships among biology, biotechnology, medicine, politics, law, and philosophy.</p><p>While scientific research has produced social benefits, it has also posed some troubling ethical questions. For example, when is it okay to test an experimental cancer drug on people? Developing a new drug takes a long time, maybe as much as 10 years, or more. There are many rules and regulations that drug researchers need to stick to while developing drugs to treat specific illnesses.</p><p>Generally, drugs cannot be tested on people until researchers have evidence that the drug does the job that they claim it does (in this case kills cancer cells), but also that the drug will not make patients more ill or cause death. However, if the drug has tested successfully in earlier experiments, and scientists are quite confident that the drug does help kill off cancer cells, is it ethical to allow patients with terminal cancer, who have no other treatment options, to try the experimental drug?</p><p>With new challenges in public health and health policy, and with advances in biotechnology, bioethics is a fast-growing academic and professional area of inquiry. Some recent bioethical debates also include:</p><p><strong role="strong">Refusal of medical treatment</strong> The choice of a patient to refuse certain life-saving medical procedures such as a blood transfusion, or refusal by a parent or guardian for medical treatment for the patient.</p><p><strong role="strong">Euthanasia</strong> The choice by a terminally ill person to have medical assistance in dying.</p><p><strong role="strong">Stem cell research</strong> Research involving stem cells, which can be harvested from human embryos.</p><p><strong role="strong">Animal cloning</strong> The ability and usefulness of scientists cloning animals for various needs, such as vaccine development, tissues for transplant into humans such as heart valve, and increased food production. Dolly the sheep, probably the most famous animal clone to date, is shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.21 <a href="#Bio12-10-fig" id="Bio12-10-text">below</a>.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2451" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio12-10-text" id="Bio12-10-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.21 <caption>Dolly the sheep is seen here with one of her lambs. In 1997, Dolly was the first mammal to be cloned, and quickly became world-famous. She was euthanized in 2003 after she developed a common, but serious lung disease. To grow her, researchers at the Roslin Institute in Scotland, collected DNA from a mammary cell of another sheep (technically her (older) twin sister), and then injected the DNA into a stem cell which had its own DNA removed. That stem cell then developed into an embryo.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>Because research may have a great effect on the wellbeing of individual people and society in general, scientists are required to behave ethically. Scientists who conduct themselves ethically treat people (called <em>subjects</em>) who are involved in their research respectfully. Subjects are not allowed to be exploited deliberately, exposed to harm, or forced to do something they do not agree to.</p><h3>Science in the Media</h3><p>A lot of popular science articles come from sources whose aim is to provide a certain amount of entertainment to the reader or viewer. Many popular science articles will examine how a phenomenon relates to people and to their environment. Nevertheless, there is a tendency in the popular media to dilute scientific debates into two sides, rather than cover the complexities and nuances of an issue.</p><p>Even well-intentioned scientists can sometimes unintentionally create truth-distorting media firestorms because of journalists' difficulty in remaining critical and balanced, the media's interest in controversy, and the general tendency of science reporting to focus on apparent "groundbreaking findings" rather than on the larger context of a research field. Sometimes scientists will seek to exploit the power of the media. When scientific results are released with great fanfare and limited peer review, the media often requires skepticism and further investigation by skilled journalists and the general public.</p><p>The dichloroacetic acid (DCA) story, discussed earlier in this lesson, is an example of what can go wrong when a scientific discovery grasps the public&rsquo;s attention.</p><p>An intense amount of public interest was raised by the study and the story received much media attention. As a result, the American Cancer Society and other medical organizations received a large volume of public interest and questions about the &ldquo;miracle cure,&rdquo; DCA.</p><p>One of the first stories about the findings contained the headline:</p><p>&ldquo;Cheap, 'safe' drug kills most cancers&rdquo;</p><p>The article did explain that the studies were only carried out on cancer cells grown in the lab and in rats. However, the headline may have given some readers the impression that human testing of DCA was complete. People were wildly interested in this new &ldquo;cure&rdquo; to cancer. This prompted the American Cancer Society and other organizations to issue reports that reminded people that although the study results were promising, no formal clinical trials in humans with cancer had yet been carried out. They stressed the need for caution in interpreting the early results. Doctors warned of possible problems if people attempted to try DCA outside a controlled clinical trial. The media received some criticism for the sensation that arose due to their coverage of the discovery.</p><p>Therefore, it is important to remember as a member of the public that some popular science news articles can be misleading. A reader can misinterpret the information, especially if the information has a emotional affect on the reader. Also, some articles are written by people who have limited understanding of the subject they are interpreting and can be produced by people who want to promote a particular point of view. Unfortunately, it can be difficult for the non-expert to identify misleading popular science. Sometimes, results are presented in the media without a context, or are exaggerated. Popular science may blur the boundaries between formal science and sensationalism. It is best to analyze such information with skepticism as you would if you were to make an observation in an investigation, and look at the whole context of an issue, rather than just the focus of a particular news item.</p><p>For example, in early 1999 West Nile virus, a virus most commonly found in Egypt, was accidentally introduced to New York. Although infection by the virus causes mostly mild or no symptoms in people, in rare instances, West Nile virus can cause inflammation of the brain. The illness, called West Nile Fever, spread across the continent from east to west, carried by infected birds. Mosquitoes spread the disease to mammals. Mosquito larvae (young) are shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.22 <a href="#Bio12-11-fig" id="Bio12-11-text">below</a>.</p><p>There was intense media coverage about the spread of this disease across the United States, and much talk about what this meant for everyone. News coverage of West Nile Fever tended to focus on the serious form of the disease, West Nile Encephalitis, which can cause harmful illness and death. The fact that there is no vaccine for the disease was also emphasized.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2480" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio12-11-text" id="Bio12-11-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.22 <caption>Mosquito larvae. As seen on the picture, larvae group together in standing water. The darker structure at the top center of the image is one pupa, another stage of the mosquito lifecycle. Mosquitoes can transfer diseases between animals, including West Nile Fever and malaria. You can avoid mosquito bites by covering your arms and legs while outside during the early morning and late evening, and by applying an insect repellant.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>However, it is worthwhile considering that until October 2007 there had been a total of 26, 997 confirmed cases of West Nile virus infection, and 1,038 confirmed deaths from the disease. Compare this to the estimated 15 to 60 million people in the United States who are infected with the flu virus every year, and the estimated 36,000 people who die every year from flu complications.</p><p>So the next time you are shocked or horrified by a seemingly gloomy forecast in the media, consider how the issue fits into the bigger story.</p><h4>Biotechnology: Science Applied to Life</h4><p><strong role="strong">Biotechnology</strong> is technology based on biology; it involves the use of organisms or biological processes and can be especially used in agriculture, food science, and medicine. It is the application of biological knowledge to develop tools and products that allow us to control and adapt to our environment.</p><p>Biotechnology has effected society and in a number of ways. Although it has been used for centuries in traditional production processes, such as animal breeding shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.23 <a href="#Bio12-12-fig" id="Bio12-12-text">below</a>, crop growing, and wine making, modern biotechnology is a recent field of science. Bioengineering is the science upon which all biotechnological applications are based. New developments and new approaches are developing at a very fast pace. Biotechnology combines scientific fields such as genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, and cell biology.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2453" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio12-12-text" id="Bio12-12-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.23 <caption>Chicks standing on a picture of a genetic map of a chicken. Mapping the genome of organisms is a major part of biotechnology.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>The field of modern biotechnology is thought to have largely begun in 1980, when the United States Supreme Court ruled that a genetically-modified microorganism could be patented. Indian-born researcher, Ananda Chakrabarty, had developed a bacterium that was able to break down crude oil, which he proposed to use in treating oil spills.</p><h4>Applications of Biotechnology</h4><p>Biotechnology has applications in four major industrial areas, including health care, crop production and agriculture, non-food uses of crops such as biofuels, and environmental uses. One application of biotechnology uses organisms to produce things such as nutritional supplements like vitamins or amino acids, and milk products like cheese, kefir, and yogurt. Biotechnology is also used to recycle, treat waste, and clean up sites contaminated by industrial waste. The use of microorganisms to clean up contaminated sites such as an oil spill is called <strong role="strong">bioremediation.</strong></p><p>Medical applications of biotechnology include designing organisms to produce medicines such as antibiotics, or other chemicals. Medical applications for people also include gene therapy which could be used to treat a person who has a genetic disorder such as cystic fibrosis.</p><p>An example of an agricultural application is designing plants to grow under specific environmental conditions or in the presence (or absence) of certain chemicals, such as the cress shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.24 <a href="#Bio12-13-fig" id="Bio12-13-text">below</a>. The cress plant has been genetically modified to turn red only in the presence of nitrogen dioxide, a chemical that is released by landmines and other unexploded bombs. Researchers at the Danish biotechnology company that developed the plant hope that the seeds can be spread over former battleground areas where they will grow and mark the sites of the explosives, thus speeding up the land mine removal process.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2485" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio12-13-text" id="Bio12-13-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.24 <caption>This thale cress  has been genetically modified to turn red only in the presence of nitrogen dioxide, a chemical marker for landmines or other unexploded bombs. Researchers hope that the cress seeds can be spread over former battleground areas, where they will grow and mark the sites of explosives, thus lessening the risk to the people and animals who live in those areas and work to remove the explosives.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>Another hope is that biotechnology might produce more environmentally friendly solutions than traditional industrial agriculture. An example of this is the engineering of a plant to express a pesticide, which cuts out the need to apply pesticides to the plants. The corn plants in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.25 <a href="#Bio12-14-fig" id="Bio12-14-text">below</a> have been genetically modified (changed) to produce a toxin that comes from a naturally occurring soil bacterium called <em>Bacillus thuringiensis.</em> The Bt toxin kills the pests that eat and destroy corn crops. Whether or not biotechnology products such as this are more environmentally friendly in the long run is a hot topic of debate.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2468" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio12-14-text" id="Bio12-14-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.25 <caption>People looking at a sign that explains what the genetically modified corn does. In an effort to reduce corn stem-borer infestations, corporate and public researchers came together to develop genetically modified corn varieties suitable for Kenya. The corn plants contain a gene ( gene) from a naturally occurring bacterium called . The Bt gene causes the corn plants to make Bt toxin which kills the pests that feed on the plants.</caption></p></div><p> </p><h4>Use of Computers in Science and Medicine</h4><p>Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field which helps solve biological problems using computers. Lots of information is gathered from the mapping of DNA sequences and other related types of research. Bioinformatics allows scientists to gather this information, share it and to use it. It also speeds up the process of analyzing data the scientists have collected. The field may also be called computational biology. Bioinformatics plays a key role in various areas, and it is a key part of the biotechnology and the pharmaceutical industries.</p><p>Psychologists David Patterson and Hunter Hoffman of the University of Washington in Seattle developed a virtual world computer game they called &ldquo;Snow World&rdquo; shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.26 <a href="#Bio12-15-fig" id="Bio12-15-text">below</a>, in an effort to reduce the pain experienced by patients undergoing burn treatment and other medical procedures. They found that people who became fully engaged in the virtual reality snow world reported 60 percent less pain. This technology offers a promising new way to manage pain. The researchers say that an interactive digital world may distract us from reality because our minds focus on just a few things at once.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2473" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio12-15-text" id="Bio12-15-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.26 <caption>A scene from the interactive Snow World. In this virtual reality game, players can move through the snowy landscape, throw snowballs, and watch penguins waddle past them. Researchers found that playing this game can distract people from the sense of burning pain. The researchers used healthy undergraduate student volunteers in these virtual world study to determine that perception can affect pain sensation.</caption></p></div><p> </p><h3>Lesson Summary</h3><ul><li>The reliability of scientific knowledge comes partly from the objectivity of scientific methods, and also from scientists discussing ideas with each other. In talking with each other, researchers must use more than just their scientific understanding of the world. They must also be able to convince other scientists of the accuracy of their ideas. </li><li>Graphics help to illustrate ideas that would otherwise be too confusing to describe in words only. </li><li>The peer review process aims to make authors meet the standards of their area of study, and to meet the expected standards of science in general. </li><li>Ethics is the discipline concerned with what is morally good and bad, right and wrong. Bioethics is the social ethics of biology and medicine; it deals with the ethical implications of biological research and applications, especially in medicine. Bioethicists are concerned with the ethical questions that arise in the relationships among biology, biotechnology, medicine, politics, law, and philosophy. </li><li>Scientists need to be able to tell each other and the public about their research and the results of their research. These two groups make up two very different audiences for scientists. Presenting academic subjects in a readable and engaging way, allows the general pubic to understand what research is being done and why. Presentation of generally written science appeals to people because it allows the reader to relate the subject to their life and experiences. </li><li>You cannot be fully informed about the scientific issues you read about unless you understand the science behind the issues, or have the ability to think like a scientist to analyze them. </li><li>The cost of equipment, transportation, rent, and salaries for the people carrying out the research all need to be considered before a scientific study can start. The systems of financial support for scientists and their work have been important influences of the type of research and the pace of research. Today, funding for research comes from many different sources. </li><li>Biotechnology is the application of biological knowledge to develop tools and products that allow us to control and adapt to our environment. </li></ul><h3>Review Questions</h3><ol start><li>What is bias in scientific terms and how is it relevant to science?</li><li>Who do you think the ethical rules about scientific research are aimed toward?
