It classifies and describes organisms, their functions, how species come into existence, and the interactions they have with each other and with the natural environment. Four unifying principles form the foundation of modern biology: cell theory, evolution, genetics and homeostasis.</p><p>Most biological sciences are specialized areas of study. Biology includes biochemistry, cell biology, microbiology, immunology, genetics, physiology, zoology, ecology, evolutionary biology, and botany. Biochemistry is the study of the chemicals that make up life. Cell biology is the study of life at the level of the cell. Microbiology is the study of microscopic organisms. Immunology is the study of an organism's resistance to disease. Genetics is the study of how organisms pass traits to their offspring. The study of how the human body works is called physiology. Zoology is the study of animals. The study of how organisms interact with their environment and each other is called ecology. Evolutionary biology is the study of how populations and species change over time. Botany is the study of plants. The four unifying principles are important foundations for each and every field of biology. Applied fields of biology such as medicine and genetic research involve many specialized areas of study.</p><h4>What is Life?</h4><p>Not all scientists agree exactly about what makes up life. Many characteristics describe most living things. However, with most of the characteristics listed below we can think of one or more examples that would seem to break the rule, with something non-living being classified as living or something living classified as non-living.</p><p>There is not just one distinguishing feature that separates a living thing from a non-living thing. A cat moves but so does a car. A tree grows bigger, but so does a cloud. A cell has structure, but so does a crystal. Biologists define life by listing characteristics that living things share. Something that has all of the characteristics of life is considered to be alive. The duck decoy in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.44 <a href="#Bio-01-04-01-fig" id="Bio-01-04-01-text">below</a> may look like a duck, act like a duck in that it floats about, but it is not alive. The decoy cannot reproduce offspring, respond to its environment, or breathe.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2461" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio-01-04-01-text" id="Bio-01-04-01-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.44 <caption>Is it a duck? Both of these objects move across the waters surface. But, how can you tell which one is alive and which is not? You can tell by seeing which of them have all of the characteristics of life.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>An individual living creature is called an <strong role="strong">organism</strong>. There are many characteristics that living organisms share. They all:</p><ul><li>respond to their environment </li><li>grow and change </li><li>reproduce and have offspring </li><li>have a complex chemistry </li><li>maintain homeostasis </li><li>are built of structures called cells </li><li>pass their traits onto their offspring </li></ul><h4>Responding to the Environment</h4><p>If you step on a rock, it will just lie there, but if you step on a turtle, it may move or even snap at you. Living things know what is going on around them, and respond to changes in the environment. An <strong role="strong">adaptation</strong> refers to the process of becoming adjusted to an environment. Adaptations may include structural, physiological, or behavioral traits that improve an organism's likelihood of survival, and thus, reproduction.</p><h4>Growth and Change</h4><p>A seed may look like a pebble, but under the right conditions it will sprout and form a seedling that will grow into a larger plant.  The pebble of course will not grow.</p><h4>Reproduction</h4><p>Living things make more organisms like themselves. Whether the organism is a rabbit, or a tree, or a bacterium, life will create more life.</p><h4>Have Complex Chemistry</h4><p>A flower has a complicated and beautiful structure. So does a crystal. But if you look closely at the crystal, you see no change. The flower, on the other hand, is transporting water through its petals, producing pigment molecules, breaking down sugar for energy, and undergoing a large number of other chemical reactions that are needed for living organisms to stay alive. We call the sum of the chemical reactions in a cell its <strong role="strong">metabolism</strong>.</p><h4>Maintain Homeostasis</h4><p>A human body has a temperature of 37&deg; Celsius, (about 98.6&deg; Fahrenheit). If you step outside on a cold morning, the temperature might be below freezing. Nevertheless, you do not become an ice cube. Your shiver and move your arms and legs about to stay warm. Eating food also gives your body the energy to keep warm. Living organisms keep their internal environments within a certain range (they maintain a stable internal condition), despite changes in their external environment. This process is called <strong role="strong">homeostasis</strong>.</p><h4>Built of Cells</h4><p>If you look closely at any organism you can see that it is made of structures called <strong role="strong">cells</strong>. Organisms that are very different such as ferns, and fish, and elephants all look very similar at the cellular level. All living organisms are made of one or more cells. Organisms are organized in the microscopic level from atoms up to cells. The matter is structured in an ordered way. Atoms are arranged into molecules, then into macromolecules, which make up organelles, which work together to form cells. Beyond this, cells are organized in higher levels to form entire multicellular organisms, as shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.45 <a href="#Bio1-4-2-fig" id="Bio1-4-2-text">below</a>. Cells together form tissues, which make up organs, which are part of organ systems, which work together to form an entire organism. Of course, beyond this, organisms form populations which make up parts of an ecosystem. All of Earth's ecosystems together form the diverse environment that is Earth.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2493" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio1-4-2-text" id="Bio1-4-2-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.45 <caption>Levels of organization in a tree.

These are:</p><h4>The Cell Theory</h4><p>The cell is the basic unit of life. The Cell Theory states that all living things are made of one or more cells, or the secretions of those cells, such as the organisms shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.46 <a href="#Bio14-03-fig" id="Bio14-03-text">below</a>. For example, shell and bone are built by cells from substances that they secrete into their surroundings. Cells come from cells that already exist, that is, they do not suddenly appear from nowhere. In organisms that are made of many cells (called multicellular organisms), every cell in the organism's body derives from the single cell that results from a fertilized egg. You will learn more about cells and the Cell Theory in the <em>Cell Structure and Function</em> chapter.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h4>Gene Theory</h4><p>A living organism's traits are encoded in their DNA, the large molecule, or macromolecule, that holds the instructions needed to build cells and organisms. DNA makes up the genes of an organism. Traits are passed on from one generation to the next by way of these genes. Information for how the organism appears and how its cells work come from the organism&rsquo;s genes. Although the appearance and cell function of the organism may change due to the organism&rsquo;s environment, the environment does not change its genes. The only way that genes can change in response to a particular environment is through the process of evolution in populations of organisms. You will learn more about DNA and genes in the <em>Molecular Genetics</em> chapter.</p><h4>Homeostasis</h4><p>Homeostasis is the ability of an organism to control its body functions in order to uphold a stable internal environment even when its external environment changes. All living organisms perform homeostasis. For example, cells maintain a stable internal acidity (pH); and warm-blooded animals maintain a constant body temperature. You will learn more about homeostasis in <em>The Human Body</em> chapter.</p><p>Homeostasis is a term that is also used when talking about the environment. For example, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide on Earth has been regulated by the concentration of plant life on Earth because plants remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during the daylight hours than they emit to the atmosphere at night.</p><h4>Evolution</h4><p>Evolution by natural selection, is the theory that maintains that a population's inherited traits change over time, and that all known organisms have a common origin. Evolutionary theory can explain how specialized features, such as the geckos sticky foot pads shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.47 <a href="#Bio01-04-04-fig" id="Bio01-04-04-text">below</a>, develop in different species. You will learn more about evolution in the <em>Evolutionary Theory</em> and <em>Evolution in Populations</em> chapters.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2459" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio01-04-04-text" id="Bio01-04-04-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.47 <caption>A Tokay Gecko. The pads at the tip of the Tokay gecko's foot are covered in microscopic hairs, each split into hundreds of tips that measure about 200 nanometers in diameter. By using these tiny hairs that can cling to smooth surfaces, the geckos are able to support their entire body weight while climbing walls, definately a product of evolution.</caption></p></div><p> </p><h3>Interdependence of Living Things</h3><p><strong role="strong">Biological interactions</strong> are the interactions between different organisms in an environment. In the natural world no organism is cut off from its surroundings. Organisms are a part of their environment which is rich in living and non-living elements that interact with each other in some way. The interactions of an organism with its environment are vital to its survival, and the functioning of the ecosystem as a whole.</p><p>These relationships can be categorized into many different classes. The interactions between two species do not necessarily need to be through direct contact. Due to the connected nature of ecosystems, species may affect each other through such relationships involving shared resources or common enemies.</p><p>The term <strong role="strong">symbiosis</strong> comes from a Greek word that means &ldquo;living together.&rdquo; Symbiosis can be used to describe various types of close relationships between organisms of different species, such as <strong role="strong">mutualism</strong> and <strong role="strong">commensalism</strong>, which are relationships in which neither organism is harmed. Sometimes the term symbiosis is used only for cases where both organisms benefit, sometimes it is used more generally to describe all kinds of close relationships, even when one organism is killed by another, as shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.48 <a href="#Bio01-04-05-fig" id="Bio01-04-05-text">below</a>. Symbiosis can also be used to describe relationships where one organism lives on or in another, called <strong role="strong">parasitism</strong>, or when one organism kills and eats another organism, called <strong role="strong">predation</strong>.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2478" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio01-04-05-text" id="Bio01-04-05-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.48 <caption>There are many different types of symbiotic interactions between organisms. Clockwise from top left:  bacteria live inside your intestines in a mutualistic relationship; the bacteria produce Vitamin K for you, and they get their food from what you eat. Lions are predators that feed on other organisms such as this Cape buffalo. Similar to the E. , this bee has a mutualistic relationship with the flower, the bee feeds from the flower, and the flower gets pollinated by the bee. Clownfish that live among the tentacles of sea anemones protect the anemone from anemone-eating fish, and in turn the stinging tentacles of the anemone protect the clownfish from its predators (a special mucus on the clownfish protects it from the stinging tentacles).</caption></p></div><p> </p><h4>Competition</h4><p>Competition is as an interaction between organisms or species, for the same resources such as water, food, or hunting grounds in an environment, shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.49 <a href="#Bio01-04-06-fig" id="Bio01-04-06-text">below</a>. Eventually, the species that is less able to compete for resources will either adapt or die out. According to evolutionary theory, competition for resources plays an important role in natural selection.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2481" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio01-04-06-text" id="Bio01-04-06-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.49 <caption>Competition between organisms and species. These male deer are competing for females during rutting (mating) season. Trees in this Bangladesh forest are in competition for light.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>Animals that eat decomposing organic material also have an important interaction with the environment. They help to decompose dead matter and assist with the recycling of nutrients. By burying and eating dung, dung beetles, such as the one shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.50 <a href="#Bio14-07-fig" id="Bio14-07-text">below</a>, improve nutrient cycling and soil structure. They make the dead organic matter available to bacteria that break it down even further.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2472" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio14-07-text" id="Bio14-07-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.50 <caption>Dung beetles have important interactions with the environment, through which many other organisms benefit.</caption></p></div><p> </p><h4>Levels of Organization</h4><p>In studying how organisms interact with each other, biologists often find it helpful to classify the organisms and interactions into levels of organization. Similar to the way an organism itself has different levels of organization, the ways in which organisms interact with their environment and each other can also be divided in to levels of organization. For example:</p><p>The <strong role="strong">biosphere</strong> includes all living things within all of their environments. It includes every place that life occurs, from the upper reaches of the atmosphere to the top few meters of soil, to the bottoms of the oceans. An <strong role="strong">ecosystem</strong> is made up of the relationships among smaller groups of organisms with each other, and their environment. Scientists often speak of the interrelatedness of living things, because, according to evolutionary theory, organisms adapt to their environment, and they must also adapt to other organisms in that environment.</p><p>A <strong role="strong">community</strong> is made up of the relationships between groups of different species. For example, the desert communities consist of rabbits, coyotes, snakes, birds, mice and such plants as sahuaro cactus, ocotillo, and creosote bush. Community structure can be disturbed by such dynamics as fire, human activity, and over-population.</p><p>It is thus possible to study biology at many levels, from collections of organisms or communities, to the inner workings of a cell (organelle). To learn more about the interactions of organisms, you will read the <em>Biomes, Ecosystems and Communities</em> and <em>Populations</em> chapters.</p><h4>The Diversity of Life</h4><p>Evolutionary theory and the cell theory give us the basis for how and why, living things relate to each other. The diversity of life found on Earth today is the result of 4 billion years of evolution. Some of this diversity is shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.51 <a href="#Bio14-08-fig" id="Bio14-08-text">below</a>. The origin of life is not completely understood by science, though limited evidence suggests that life may already have been well-established a few 100 million years after Earth formed. Until approximately 600 million years ago, all life was made up of single-celled organisms.</p><p>The level of biodiversity found in the fossil record suggests that the last few million years include the period of greatest biodiversity in the Earth's history. However, not all scientists support this view, since there is a lot of uncertainty as to how strongly the fossil record is biased by the greater availability and preservation of more recent fossil-containing rock layers. Some researchers argue that modern biodiversity is not much different from biodiversity 300 million years ago. Estimates of the present global species diversity vary from 2 million to 100 million species, with a best estimate of somewhere near 10 million species. All living organisms are classified into one of the six kingdoms: Archaebacteria (Archaea), Eubacteria (Bacteria), Protista (Protists), Fungi, Plantae (Plants), and Animalia (Animals).</p><p>New species are regularly discovered and many, though already discovered, are not yet classified. One estimate states that about 40 percent of freshwater fish from South America are not yet classified. Every year, scientists discover the existence of many hundreds more archaea and bacteria than were previously known about. Just a few of the many members of the animal kingdom are shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.51 <a href="#Bio14-08-fig" id="Bio14-08-text">below</a>. The animal kingdom is just a tiny portion of the total diversity of life. To learn more about the diversity of living creatures, you will read the <em>Classification; Prokaryotes and Viruses; Protists; Fungi; Evolution and Classification of Plants; and Introduction to Animals and Invertebrates</em> chapters.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2448" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio14-08-text" id="Bio14-08-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.51 <caption>Animal diversity. This figure shows just a fraction of the diversity of life. The diversity of organisms found in the five kingdoms of life, dwarf the number of organisms found in the animal kingdom. The other kingdoms of life are Eubacteria, Archaebacteria, Protista, Fungi, and Plantae.</caption></p></div><p> </p><h3>Evolution of Life</h3><p><strong role="strong">Evolution</strong> is the process by which populations of organisms change over time.  These organisms acquire and pass on new traits from generation to the next generation. Its occurrence over large stretches of time explains the origin of new species and the great diversity of the biological world. <strong role="strong">Extant</strong> species are related to each other through common descent, and products of evolution over billions of years. Analysis of the DNA of different organisms indicate there is a similarity in the DNA genetic codes that help make proteins and other molecules in very different organisms. These genetic codes are used by all known forms of life on Earth, and are very similar. The theory of evolution suggests that the genetic code was established very early in the history of life and some studies suggest it was established soon after the formation of Earth. The timeline of the evolution of life, shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.52 <a href="#Bio14-09-fig" id="Bio14-09-text">below</a>, outlines the major events in the development of life.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2469" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio14-09-text" id="Bio14-09-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.52 <caption>According to recent estimates, the Earth is about 4.5 billion years old. Most of the evidence for an ancient Earth is contained in the rocks that form the Earth's crust. The rock layers themselves, like pages in thick history book, record the surface shaping events of the past. Buried within them are traces of life, including the plants and animals that evolved from organic structures that existed perhaps as many as 3 billion years ago.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>How do scientists know Earth is so old? The answer is in the rocks. Contained in rocks that were once molten, shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.53 <a href="#Bio14-10-fig" id="Bio14-10-text">below</a>, are chemical elements that act like an atomic clock. The atoms of different forms of elements (called isotopes) break down at different rates over time. Parent isotopes within these rocks decay at a predictable rate to form daughter isotopes. By determining the relative amounts of parent and daughter isotopes, the age of these rocks can be calculated&mdash;forming the so-called atomic clock.</p><p>Thus, the results of studies of rock layers (stratigraphy), and of fossils (paleontology), along with the ages of certain rocks as measured by atomic clocks (geochronology), indicate that the Earth is over 4.5 billion years old, with the oldest known rocks being 3.96 billion years old. To learn more about the history of life on Earth, you will read the History of Life chapter.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2456" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio14-10-text" id="Bio14-10-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.53 <caption>Molten rock, called , is expelled by a volcano during an eruption. The lava will eventually cool to become solid rock. When first expelled from a volcanic vent, it is a liquid at temperatures from 700 C to 1,200 C (1,300 F to 2,200 F). Not all types of rocks come from cooled lava, but many do. Additional images/videos of volcanic eruptions can be seen at Hawaii Volcanic Eruption with Lightning and USGS Kilauea Volcano ( and </caption></p></div><p> </p><h4>History of Evolutionary Thought</h4><p>The theory of evolution by natural selection was proposed at about the same time by both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.54 <a href="#Bio01-04-11-fig" id="Bio01-04-11-text">below</a>, and was set out in detail in Darwin's 1859 book <em>On the Origin of Species</em>. <strong role="strong">Natural selection</strong> is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more "fit" to survive in a particular environment and have "adapted" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment. Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2445" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio01-04-11-text" id="Bio01-04-11-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.54 <caption>Charles Darwin, left (1809-1882), and Alfred Russel Wallace, right (1823-1913).

However, Darwin was first to publish his findings.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>The theory of evolution encountered initial resistance from religious authorities who believed humans were divinely set apart from the animal kingdom. There was considerable concern about Darwin&rsquo;s proposal of an entirely scientific explanation for the origin of humans. Many people found such an explanation to be in direct conflict with their religious beliefs. A caricature of Darwin as a monkey, shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.55 <a href="#Bio14-12-fig" id="Bio14-12-text">below</a>, reflects the controversy that arose over evolutionary theory. In the 1930s, Darwinian natural selection was combined with Mendelian inheritance to form the basis of modern evolutionary theory.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2447" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio14-12-text" id="Bio14-12-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.55 <caption>An 1871 caricature portraying Darwin with an ape body and the bushy beard he grew in 1866. Such satire reflected the cultural backlash against evolution.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>The identification of DNA as the genetic material by Oswald Avery and colleagues in the 1940s, as well as the publication of the structure of DNA by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953, demonstrated the physical basis for inheritance. Since then, genetics and molecular biology have become core aspects of evolutionary biology.</p><p>Currently the study of evolutionary biology involves scientists from fields as diverse as biochemistry, ecology, genetics and physiology, and evolutionary concepts are used in even more distant disciplines such as psychology, medicine, philosophy and computer science.</p><h4>Misconceptions About Evolution</h4><p>The following list includes some common misconceptions about evolution.</p><ul><li>The term evolution describes the changes that occur in populations of living organisms over time. Describing these changes does not address the origin of life. The two are commonly and mistakenly confused. Biological evolution likewise says nothing about cosmology, the Big Bang, or where the universe, galaxy, solar system, or Earth came from. </li><li>Humans did not evolve from chimpanzees or any other modern ape; instead they share a common ancestor that existed around 7 million years ago. </li><li>The process of evolution is not necessarily slow. Millions of years are not required to see evolution in action. Indeed, it has been observed multiple times under both controlled laboratory conditions and in nature. </li><li>Evolution is not a progression from "lower" to "higher" forms of life, and it does not increase in complexity. For example, bacteria have simpler structures and a smaller amount of genetic material than humans do. This does not mean however, that bacteria are &ldquo;less evolved&rdquo; than humans are. Bacteria have evolved over many millions of years and are well adapted to their own environments. </li></ul><h4>After Darwin</h4><p>Since Darwin's time, scientists have gathered a more complete fossil record, including microorganisms and chemical fossils. These fossils have supported and added more information to Darwin's theories. However, the age of the Earth is now held to be much older than Darwin thought. Researchers have also uncovered some of the preliminary mysteries of the mechanism of heredity as carried out through genetics and DNA, which were areas unknown to Darwin. Another growing subject is the study of comparative anatomy, which looks at how different organisms have similar body structures. Molecular biology studies of slowly changing genes reveal an evolutionary history that is consistent with fossil and anatomical records.</p><h3>Lesson Summary</h3><ul><li>Biochemistry is the study of the chemicals that make up life. Cell biology is the study of life at the level of the cell. Microbiology is the study of microscopic organisms. Genetics is the study of how organisms pass traits to their offspring. The study of how the human body works is called physiology. Zoology is the study of animals. The study of how organisms interact with their environment and each other is called ecology. Evolutionary biology is the study of how populations and species of animals change over time. Botany is the study of plants. </li><li>The seven characteristics of life include: responsiveness to the environment; growth and change; ability to reproduce; have a metabolism and breathe; maintain homeostasis; being made of cells; passing traits onto offspring. </li><li>Four unifying principles form the foundation of modern biology: cell theory, evolution, genetics and homeostasis. These four principles are important to each and every field of biology. </li><li>Symbiosis can be used to describe various types of close relationships between organisms of different species, such as mutualism and commensalism, which are relationships in which neither organism is harmed. Sometimes the term symbiosis is used only for cases where both organisms benefit, but sometimes it is used more generally to describe all kinds of close relationships, even when one organism is killed by another. Symbiosis can also be used to describe relationships where one organism lives on or in another, called parasitism, or when one organism kills and eats another organism, called predation. Competition is as an interaction between organisms or species for the same resources in an environment. </li><li>Analysis of the DNA of different organisms indicate that there is a similarity in the DNA genetic codes that help make proteins and other molecules in very different organisms. These genetic codes are used by all known forms of life on Earth, and are very similar. The theory of evolution suggests that the genetic code was established very early in the history of life and some studies suggest it was established soon after the formation of Earth. </li></ul><h3>Review Questions</h3><ol start><li>Identify three of the seven characteristics of living things.</li><li>Identify the four unifying principles of modern biology.</li><li>List two different types of interactions that organisms can have with each other.</li><li>Outline the formation of modern evolutionary theory.</li><li>Give an example of how you are interdependent from another organism.</li><li>You find an object that looks like a dead, brown leaf, but it also looks like it might have eyes and legs--features that leaves do not usually have.

Consider what type of hypothesis could be made that might challenge evolutionary theory. Likewise, consider what type of hypothesis could challenge the cell theory. </li><li>As you read through other chapters in this book, it might help to remember that studying biology does not just mean learning facts by memory or repetition. By studying biology you are developing a knowledge and understanding of the world around you. And, combined with your study of other subjects such as literature, social studies, art, music, mathematics, and physical sciences, you will develop a fuller, deeper understanding of what it is to be a human being who interacts with and lives an interdependent life with other organisms (including other humans!) in your environment. </li></ul><p>&ldquo;Intellectual growth should commence at birth and cease only at death.&rdquo; - <strong role="strong">Albert Einstein</strong></p>
