<h2>Lesson 1.3: Tools and Techniques</h2><h3>Lesson Objectives</h3><ul><li>Identify the units of measurement that scientists use. </li><li>Contrast light microscopes and electron microscopes. </li><li>Identify three items that are common to science labs. </li><li>Outline the importance of mathematics to scientific research. </li><li>Outline what students and researchers can do to stay safe while working in the lab. </li></ul><h3>Introduction</h3><p>Scientists need to know they are talking the same language when it comes to measurements and analysis of data. Therefore a &ldquo;standard language of measurement&rdquo; called the SI system is used in scientific research. Other standard procedures and techniques are carried out so that scientists from around the world can understand what was done to get to a particular conclusion. These involve standard laboratory procedures and equipment, such as microscopes.</p><h3>Units of Measurement</h3><p>The measurements that scientists use are based on the <strong role="strong">International System of Units (SI),</strong> which is a form of the metric system. The term SI is shortened from the French term <em>Le Syst&egrave;me international d'unit&eacute;s</em>. It is the world's most widely used system of units, both in science and business. It is useful to scientists because it is based on multiples of 10. The SI was developed in 1960 from an older metric system and is used in almost every country.</p><p>The SI is not static, as the technology of measurement progresses, units are created and definitions are changed through international agreement among many nations. The international system of units is made up of a seven base units, shown in <strong role="strong">Table 2.2</strong>  1.2 <a href="#table:&quot; title-fig" id="table:&quot; title-text">below</a> lists SI Base Units. From these seven base units several other units are derived.</p><div><p><strong>Table </strong>1.1 </p><table><p></p><thead><tr><td>Name</td><td>Symbol</td><td>Quantity</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>meter</td><td>m</td><td>length</td></tr><tr><td>kilogram</td><td>kg</td><td>mass</td></tr><tr><td>second</td><td>s</td><td>time</td></tr><tr><td>ampere</td><td>A</td><td>electric current</td></tr><tr><td>kelvin</td><td>K</td><td>thermal energy (temperature)</td></tr><tr><td>mole</td><td>mol</td><td>amount of substance</td></tr><tr><td>candela</td><td>cd</td><td>luminous intensity</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>A prefix may be added to SI units to make a multiple of the original unit. An <strong role="strong">SI prefix</strong> is a name or symbol that is put before a unit of measure (or its symbol) to form a decimal or a multiple of the unit. For example, <em>kilo</em>- is a multiple of a thousand and <em>milli</em>- is a multiple of a thousandth, so there are one thousand <em>millimeters</em> in a meter, and one thousand meters in a <em>kilometer</em>. All prefixes are multiples of 10, as you can see from <strong role="strong">Table 2.3</strong>  1.2 <a href="#table:&quot; title-fig" id="table:&quot; title-text">below</a> lists SI Prefixes. The prefixes are never combined; a millionth of a kilogram is a <em>milligram</em> not a <em>microkilogram</em>.</p><div><p><strong>Table </strong>1.1 </p><table><p></p><thead><tr><td>Name</td><td>Symbol</td><td>Factor of 10</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong role="strong">tera-</strong></td><td>T</td><td>1,000,000,000,000 (10<sup>12</sup>)</td><td>trillion (thousand billion)</td></tr><tr><td><strong role="strong">giga-</strong></td><td>G</td><td>1,000,000,000 (10<sup>9</sup>)</td><td>billion (thousand million)</td></tr><tr><td><strong role="strong">mega-</strong></td><td>M</td><td>1,000,000 (10<sup>6</sup>)</td><td>million</td></tr><tr><td><strong role="strong">kilo-</strong></td><td>k</td><td>1000 (10<sup>3</sup>)</td><td>thousand</td></tr><tr><td><strong role="strong">hecto-</strong></td><td>h</td><td>100 (10<sup>2</sup>)</td><td>hundred</td></tr><tr><td><strong role="strong">deca-</strong></td><td>da</td><td>10 (10<sup>1</sup>)</td><td>ten</td></tr><tr><td><strong role="strong">deci-</strong></td><td>d</td><td>1 (10<sup>-1</sup>)</td><td>tenth</td></tr><tr><td><strong role="strong">centi-</strong></td><td>c</td><td>0.1 (10<sup>-2</sup>)</td><td>hundredth</td></tr><tr><td><strong role="strong">milli-</strong></td><td>m</td><td>0.01 (10<sup>-3</sup>)</td><td>thousandth</td></tr><tr><td><strong role="strong">micro-</strong></td><td>&micro;</td><td>0.00001 (10<sup>-6</sup>)</td><td>millionth</td></tr><tr><td><strong role="strong">nano-</strong></td><td>n</td><td>0.00000001 (10<sup>-9</sup>)</td><td>billionth</td></tr><tr><td><strong role="strong">pico-</strong></td><td>p</td><td>0.00000000001 (10<sup>-12</sup>)</td><td>trillionth</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3>The Laboratory</h3><p>A laboratory is a place that has controlled conditions in which scientific research, experiments, and measurement may be carried out. Scientific laboratories can be found in schools and universities, in industry, in government facilities, and even aboard ships and spacecraft, such as the one shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.27 <a href="#Bio01-03-01-fig" id="Bio01-03-01-text">below</a>.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2439" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio01-03-01-text" id="Bio01-03-01-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.27 <caption>Labs are not always Earth-bound, like the biochemistry lab to the left is. This astronaut is working in a lab on the International Space Station (right).</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>Because of the different areas of science, there are many different types of science labs that each include different scientific equipment. For example, a physics lab might contain a particle accelerator, in which the particles that make up atoms are studied. A chemistry or biology lab most likely contains a fume hood where substances with poisonous fumes can be worked. A particle accelerator and a fume hood are both shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.28 <a href="#Bio01-03-02-fig" id="Bio01-03-02-text">below</a>.  Despite the great differences among labs, some features are common in them.</p><p>Most labs have workbenches or countertops at which the scientist may sit or stand to do work comfortably. This is important because scientists can spend all day working in the lab. A scientist usually records an experiment's progress in a lab notebook, but modern labs almost always contain a computer for data collection and analysis. In many labs computers are also used for lab simulations (modeling or imitating an experiment or a natural process), and for presenting results in the form of graphs or tables.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2486" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio01-03-02-text" id="Bio01-03-02-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.28 <caption>Different fields of science need different types of equipment, such as the particle accelerator at left, found in a physics lab, and the fume hood, at right, found in chemistry labs, but also sometimes in biology labs.</caption></p></div><p> </p><h3>Lab Equipment</h3><p><em>Lab techniques</em> include the procedures used in science to carry out an experiment. Lab techniques follow scientific methods, and while some of them involve the use of simple laboratory equipment such as glassware (shown on the shelves in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.27 <a href="#Bio01-03-01-fig" id="Bio01-03-01-text">above</a>), others use more complex and expensive equipment such as electrical and computerized machines such as the particle accelerator shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.28 <a href="#Bio01-03-02-fig" id="Bio01-03-02-text">above</a>, or use expensive supplies.</p><p>Equipment commonly found in a biology labs include microscopes, weighing scales or balances, water baths, glassware (such as test tubes, flasks, and beakers), Bunsen burners, tongs, pipettes shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.29 <a href="#Bio13-03-fig" id="Bio13-03-text">below</a>, chemical reagents, lab coats, goggles, and biohazard waste containers.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2477" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio13-03-text" id="Bio13-03-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.29 <caption>Pipettes are small, but important tools in many biology labs. Micropipettes, such as these here, are calibrated to measure very small amounts of liquids. For example, 100 microliters (100 L) which is about half the volume of your little finger tip; or even 1 L, which is smaller than a drop of water.</caption></p></div><p> </p><h3>Light Microscopes</h3><p>Microscopes are instruments used to view objects that are too small to be seen by the naked eye. Optical microscopes, such as the one shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.30 <a href="#Bio01-03-04-fig" id="Bio01-03-04-text">below</a>, use visible light and lenses to magnify objects. They are the simplest and most widely used type of microscopes. Compound microscopes are optical microscopes which have a series of lenses, and have uses in many fields of science, particularly biology and geology. The scientist in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.31 <a href="#Bio13-05-fig" id="Bio13-05-text">below</a> is looking through a compound light microscope that is fitted with a digital camera.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2440" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio01-03-04-text" id="Bio01-03-04-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.30 <caption>Compound light microscopes use lenses to focus light. Typical magnification of a light microscope is up to 1500x. This microscope has two optical lenses and is called a stereo microscope. The various parts of the microscope are labeled.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2487" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio13-05-text" id="Bio13-05-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.31 <caption>This scientist is using a stereo microscope, which is a light microscope with two ocular lenses (the microscope lense that is closest to the eye). The microscope is fitted with a digital imaging device that can take digital photos of what the researcher sees.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p><strong role="strong">Resolution</strong> is a measure of the clarity of an image; it is the minimum distance two points can be separated and still be distinguished as two separate points. Because light beams have a physical size, which is described in <em>wavelengths</em>, it is difficult to see an object that is about the same size or smaller than the wavelength of light. Objects smaller than about 0.2 micrometers appear fuzzy, and objects below that size cannot be seen.</p><p><strong role="strong">Magnification</strong> involves enlarging the image of an object so that it appears much bigger than its actual size. Magnification also refers to the number of times an object is magnified. For example, a lens that magnifies 100X, magnifies an object 100 times larger than its actual size. Light microscopes have three objective lenses that have different magnifications, as shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.32 <a href="#Bio13-06-fig" id="Bio13-06-text">below</a>. The ocular lens has a magnification of 10X, so a 100X objective lens and the ocular lens together will magnify an object by 1000X.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2471" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio13-06-text" id="Bio13-06-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.32 <caption>Objective lenses of a light microscope.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>Visible light has wavelengths of 400 to 700 nanometers, which is larger than many objects of interest such as the insides of cells. Scientists use different types of microscopes in order to get better resolution and magnification of objects that are smaller than the wavelength of visible light. Objects that are to be viewed under an electron microscope may need to be specially prepared to make them suitable for magnification.</p><h3>Electron Microscopes</h3><p>Electron microscopes use electrons instead of photons (light), because electrons have a much shorter wavelength than photons and thus allow a researcher to see things at very high magnification, far higher than an optical microscope can possibly magnify.</p><p>There are two general types of electron microscopes: the Transmission Electron Microscope that shoots electrons through the sample and measures how the electron beam changes because it is scattered in the sample, and the Scanning Electron Microscope that scans an electron beam over the surface of an object and measures how many electrons are scattered back.</p><p><strong role="strong">Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)</strong> is an imaging method in which a beam of electrons is passed through a specimen. An image is formed on photographic film or a fluorescent screen by the electrons that scatter when passing through the object. TEM images show the inside of the object.</p><p>The <strong role="strong">scanning electron microscope (SEM)</strong> is a type of electron microscope capable of producing high-resolution images of a sample surface. Due to the manner in which the image is created, SEM images have a characteristic three-dimensional appearance and are useful for judging the surface structure of the sample. Sometimes objects need to be specially prepared to make them better suited for imaging under the scanning electron microscope, as shown with the insect in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.33 <a href="#Bio13-07-fig" id="Bio13-07-text">below</a>.</p><p>Electron microscopes work under low pressures and usually in a vacuum chamber to avoid scattering the electrons in the gas. This makes the microscopes considerably larger and more expensive than optical microscopes. The different types of images from the two electron microscopes are shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.34 <a href="#Bio01-03-08-fig" id="Bio01-03-08-text">below</a>.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2466" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio13-07-text" id="Bio13-07-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.33 <caption>This insect has been coated in gold, as part of the preparation for viewing with an SEM.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2488" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio01-03-08-text" id="Bio01-03-08-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.34 <caption>SEM and TEM images of the algae . The SEM image, shown at the right, is a three-dimensional image of the surface of the organism, whereas the TEM image is a two-dimensional image of the interior of the organism.</caption></p></div><p> </p><h4>Aseptic Technique</h4><p>In the microbiology lab, <strong role="strong">aseptic technique</strong> refers to the procedures that are carried out under sterile conditions. Scientists who study microbes are called microbiologists. Microbiologists must carry out their lab work using the aseptic technique to prevent microbial contamination of themselves, contamination of the environment they are working in, including work surfaces or equipment, and contamination of the sample they are working on. Bacteria live on just about every surface on Earth, so if a scientist wants to grow a particular type of bacterium in the lab, he or she needs to be able to sterilize their equipment to prevent contamination by other bacteria or microorganisms. The aseptic technique is also used in medicine, where it is important to keep the human body free of contamination.</p><p>Aseptic technique is used whenever bacteria or other microbes are transferred between nutrient media or in the preparation of the nutrient media. Some equipment that is used in the aseptic technique include a Bunsen burner, an autoclave (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.35 <a href="#Bio13-09-fig" id="Bio13-09-text">below</a>), hand and surface sanitizers, neoprene gloves, and a fume hood.</p><p>Students of microbiology are taught the principles of aseptic technique by hands-on laboratory practice. Practice is essential in learning how to handle the lab tools without contaminating them.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2449" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio13-09-text" id="Bio13-09-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.35 <caption>A worktop autoclave. Autoclaves commonly use steam heated to 121C (250F), at 103 kPa (15 psi) above atmospheric pressure. Solid surfaces are effectively sterilized when heated to this temperature. Liquids can also be sterilized by this process, though additional time is required to reach sterilizing temperature.</caption></p></div><p> </p><h3>Scientific Models</h3><p>Scientific models are representations of reality. To describe particular parts of a phenomenon, or the interactions among a set of phenomena, it is sometimes helpful to develop a model of the phenomenon. For instance, a scale model of a house or of a solar system is clearly not an actual house or an actual solar system; the parts of an actual house or an actual solar system represented by a scale model are, only in limited ways, representative of the actual objects.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2490" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio13-10-text" id="Bio13-10-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.36 <caption>A model of planets of the solar system. This model is clearly not a real solar system; it is a representation of the planets Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and Uranus. Scientists use representations of natural things to learn more about them. Also, the visitors to the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles can get a better idea of the relative sizes of the planets (and Pluto!) by observing this model.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p><strong role="strong">Scientific modeling</strong> is the process of making abstract models of natural phenomena. An <strong role="strong">abstract model</strong> is a theoretical construct that represents something. Models are developed to allow reasoning within a simplified framework that is similar to the phenomena being investigated. The simplified model may assume certain things that are known to be incomplete in some details. Such assumptions can be useful in that they simplify the model, while at the same time, allowing the development of acceptably accurate solutions. These models play an important role in developing scientific theories.</p><p>A <strong role="strong">simulation</strong> is a model that runs over time. A simulation brings a model to life and shows how a particular object or phenomenon will behave. It is useful for testing, analysis or training where real-world systems or concepts can be represented by a model. For the scientist, a model also provides a way for calculations to be expanded to explore what might happen in different situations. This method often takes the form of models that can be programmed into computers. The scientist controls the basic assumptions about the variables in the model, and the computer runs the simulation, eventually coming to a complicated answer.</p><p>Examples of models include:</p><ul><li>Computer models </li><li>Weather forecast models </li><li>Molecular models </li><li>Climate models </li><li>Ecosystem models </li><li>Geologic models </li></ul><p>One of the main aims of scientific modeling is to allow researchers to quantify their observations about the world. In this way, researchers hope to see new things that may have escaped the notice of other researchers. There are many techniques that model builders use which allow us to discover things about a phenomenon that may not be obvious to everyone.</p><ul><li>The National Weather Service Enhanced Radar Images web site (<a href="http://radar.weather.gov/)">http://radar.weather.gov/)</a> is an excellent example of a simulation. The site exhibits current weather forecasts across the United States. </li></ul><h4>Evaluating Models</h4><p>A person who builds a model must be able to recognize whether a model reflects reality. They must also be able to identify and work with differences between actual data and theory.</p><p>A model is evaluated mostly by how it reflects past observations of the phenomenon. Any model that is not consistent with reproducible observations must be modified or rejected. However, a fit to observed data alone is not enough for a model to be accepted as valid. Other factors important in evaluating a model include:</p><ul><li>Its ability to explain past observations </li><li>Its ability to predict future observations </li><li>Its ability to control events </li><li>The cost of its use, especially when used with other models </li><li>Ease of use and how it looks </li></ul><p>Some examples of the different types of models that are used by science are shown in <strong role="strong">Figures</strong>  1.37 <a href="#Bio13-11-fig" id="Bio13-11-text">below</a> and  1.38 <a href="#Bio13-12-fig" id="Bio13-12-text">below</a>.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2464" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio13-11-text" id="Bio13-11-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.37 <caption>A computer model of wind patterns across the continental United States for 19 November, 2007.

To learn more about biomes and ecosystems, go to the  chapter.</caption></p></div><p> </p><h4>Theories as "Models"</h4><p>Theories are constructed in order to explain, predict and understand phenomena. This could include the movement of planets, weather patterns, or the behavior of animals, for example. In many instances we are constructing models of reality. A theory makes generalizations about observations and is made up of a related set of ideas and models. The important difference between theories and models is that the first is explanatory as well as descriptive, while the second is only descriptive and predictive in a much more limited sense.</p><h3>Lab Safety</h3><p>In some laboratories, conditions are no more dangerous than in any other room. In many labs, though, additional hazards are present. Laboratory hazards are as varied as the subjects of study in laboratories, and might include poisons, infectious agents, flammable, explosive, or radioactive materials, moving machinery, extreme temperatures, or high voltage. The hazard symbols for corrosive, explosive, and flammable substances are shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.39 <a href="#Bio01-03-13-fig" id="Bio01-03-13-text">below</a>. In laboratories where conditions might be dangerous, safety precautions are important.

Needles or other sharp items that have been used are dropped into the container without touching the outside of the container. Objects should never be pushed or forced into the container, as damage to the container or injuries may result.</p><p><strong role="strong">Laminar Flow Cabinet</strong> A carefully enclosed bench designed to prevent contamination of biological samples. Air is drawn through a fine filter and blown in a very smooth, laminar (streamlined) flow towards the user. The cabinet is usually made of stainless steel with no gaps or joints where microorganisms might collect.</p><p><strong role="strong">Gloves</strong> Due to possible allergic reactions to latex, latex gloves are not recommended for lab use. Instead, vinyl or nitrile gloves, shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.41 <a href="#Bio13-15-fig" id="Bio13-15-text">below</a>, are often used.

The coat helps to protect the researcher&rsquo;s clothes from splashes or contamination. The garment is made from white cotton or linen to allow it to be washed at high temperature and make it easy to see if it is clean.</p><h4>Safe Laboratory Practice</h4><p>Safety precautions are in place to help prevent accidents. Always wear personal protective equipment such as goggles and gloves when recommended to do so by your teacher.</p><ul><li>Tell your teacher immediately if an accident happens. </li><li>The production of aerosols due to poor technique such as squirting the last drop out of pipettes, and the spread of contamination due to spills is completely avoidable and especially important if you are handling infectious material or chemicals. </li><li>Wear enclosed toe shoes, instead of sandals or flip flops, or thongs. Your feet and toes could easily get hurt or broken or if you dropped something.

Now we need to turn our attention to Biology. Biology is the study of life. As the &lsquo;study of life,&rsquo; a knowledge of biology is an extremely important aspect of your education. Biology includes the identification and analysis of characteristics common to all living organisms. What is known about biology is discovered or identified through the same processes as all other sciences, including the scientific method and peer review process.</p><h3>Lesson Summary</h3><ul><li>The measurements that scientists use are based on the International System of Units (SI), which is form of the metric system. Based on multiples of ten, It is the world's most widely used system of units, both in science and business. </li><li>One important use for mathematics in science is the role it plays in expressing scientific models. Statistics allow scientists to assess the reliability and range of differences in experimental results. </li><li>Light microscopes use visible light and lenses to magnify objects. They are the simplest and most widely used type of microscopes. Electron microscopes use electrons instead of photons (light), because electrons have a much shorter wavelength than photons and therefore allow a researcher to see things at very high magnification, that greatly exceeds what an optical microscope can possibly magnify. Electron microscopes are larger and more expensive than light microscopes. </li><li>Equipment commonly found in a biology labs include microscopes, weighing scales or balances, water baths, glassware (such as test tubes, flasks, and beakers), Bunsen burners, tongs, pipettes, chemical reagents, lab coats, goggles, and biohazard waste containers. </li><li>Always wear personal protective equipment such as goggles and gloves, wear enclosed shoes, and do not eat or drink in the lab. </li></ul><h3>Review Questions</h3><ol start><li>Which one of the following units of measurement would be the most appropriate in determining the mass of a banana? Kilograms, micrograms, or grams.</li><li>Identify the type of microscope that is most common in laboratories.</li><li>Contrast microscope magnification and resolution.</li><li>If an objective lens magnifies an object by 45&times;, and the optical lens magnifies by 10&times;. By how much will the object be magnified to the viewer?</li><li>Which object is larger? An object with a diameter of 1500 micrometers (&micro;m) or an object with a diameter of 15 millimeters (mm)?</li><li>Why is it important that scientists use common units of measurement?</li><li>Name three pieces of safety equipment that you should wear while carrying out an investigation in the lab.</li><li>What should you first do if an accident happens in the lab?</li><li>If you saw this hazard sign on a chemical container, what do you think it might mean? <p><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2475" width="256px" /></div></p></li><li>How are computer models similar to the real world, and how do they differ?</li></ol><h3>Further Reading / Supplemental Links</h3><ul><li><a href="http://www.chem.unl.edu/safety/hslabcon.html"> </a><a href="http://www.chem.unl.edu/safety/hslabcon.html">http://www.chem.unl.edu/safety/hslabcon.html</a></li><li><a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Nanotechnology/Electron_microscopy"> </a><a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Nanotechnology/Electron_microscopy">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Nanotechnology/Electron_microscopy</a></li></ul><h3>Vocabulary</h3><dl><dt>aseptic technique </dt><dd>Laboratory  procedures that are carried out under sterile conditions. </dd></dl><dl><dt>compound microscope </dt><dd>An optical microscopes that has a series of lenses, and have uses in many fields of science, particularly biology and geology. </dd></dl><dl><dt>electron microscope </dt><dd>A microscope that uses electrons instead of light; allow a researcher to see things at very high magnification, far higher than an optical microscope can possibly magnify. </dd></dl><dl><dt>International System of Units (SI) </dt><dd>The measurements that scientists use; a form of the metric system. </dd></dl><dl><dt>lab coat </dt><dd>A knee-length overcoat that is usually worn while working in the lab; helps to protect the researcher&rsquo;s clothes from splashes or contamination. </dd></dl><dl><dt>laboratory </dt><dd>A place that has controlled conditions in which scientific research, experiments, and measurement may be carried out. </dd></dl><dl><dt>lab techniques </dt><dd>The procedures used in science to carry out an experiment. </dd></dl><dl><dt>magnification </dt><dd>Enlarging an image of an object so that it appears much bigger than its actual size; also refers to the number of times an object is magnified. </dd></dl><dl><dt>microscopes </dt><dd>Instruments used to view objects that are too small to be seen by the naked eye. </dd></dl><dl><dt>model </dt><dd>A physical, mathematical, or logical representation of a system, phenomenon, or process; allow scientists to investigate a phenomenon in a controlled way. </dd></dl><dl><dt>optical microscope </dt><dd>A microscope that uses visible light and lenses to magnify objects. </dd></dl><dl><dt>resolution </dt><dd>A measure of the clarity of an image; it is the minimum distance two points can be separated and still be distinguished as two separate points. </dd></dl><dl><dt>scanning electron microscope (SEM) </dt><dd>Electron microscope that scans an electron beam over the surface of an object and measures how many electrons are scattered back. </dd></dl><dl><dt>scientific modeling </dt><dd>The process of making abstract models of natural phenomena. </dd></dl><dl><dt>simulation </dt><dd>A model that runs over time; brings a model to life and shows how a particular object or phenomenon will behave. </dd></dl><dl><dt>stereo microscope </dt><dd>A light microscope with two ocular lenses. </dd></dl><dl><dt>transmission electron microscope (TEM) </dt><dd>Electron microscope that shoots electrons through the sample and measures how the electron beam changes because it is scattered in the sample. </dd></dl><h3>Points to Consider</h3><ul><li>Consider how much more difficult it would be to carry out investigations without the use of computers, and the types of models that have developed due to the development of computers. </li><li>Consider reasons why eating and drinking are not allowed in the lab. </li><li>What additional ethical considerations would there be if you were working with living organisms in the lab, such as mice, rats, or other mammals? </li></ul>
