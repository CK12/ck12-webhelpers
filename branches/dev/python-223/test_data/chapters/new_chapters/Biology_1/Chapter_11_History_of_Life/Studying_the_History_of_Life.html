Vast is the almost unimaginable expanse of time during which life has flourished: four billion years is our current best estimate! Wondrous is the diversity of species throughout that time: some 30 million species occupy Earth today, and over 90% of all which have ever lived are extinct. Dramatic are the tales of change in environment and in diversity: ice ages, volcanism, continental drift, mass extinction, and bursts of evolutionary creativity have all shaped the natural environment. Humbling is the recognition that humans have played a relatively small part in the history; if the 4.6 billion-year story of Earth is reduced to a single <strong role="strong">cosmological day,</strong> humans occupy just the last minute and a half, and civilization covers less than the final second (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.1 <a href="#Bio11-01-fig" id="Bio11-01-text">below</a>). Ennobling is the story&rsquo;s revelation that we are related to and interdependent with all other species &ndash; back 4 billion years to &ldquo;so simple a beginning&rdquo; (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.2 <a href="#Bio11-1-2-fig" id="Bio11-1-2-text">below</a>). Finally, the history of life suggests we might add one more striking impression: Terrifying is the realization that we are in many ways unique among species in our unprecedented power to change the environment, influence evolution, and destroy life&rsquo;s diversity.</p><p>If we as a species occupy just the last minute and one-half of the cosmological day, how can we know the vast history of that 4.6 billion-year &ldquo;day?" How did we arrive at 4.6 billion years as the age of the earth? How we know is the topic of this first lesson on the history of life.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2737" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio11-01-text" id="Bio11-01-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.1 <caption>This Earth clock condenses the 4.5 billion years of earths history into a single 24-hour day.

Our understanding of where they belong in the tale is relatively recent, but &ldquo;dragon bones&rdquo; have been known for thousands of years in China and Europe. <strong role="strong">Fossils</strong> are preserved remains or traces of organisms that provide extremely rare but vivid windows to the past. Because most parts of organisms decompose rapidly following death, fossilization is an exceptionally uncommon occurrence, and usually preserves only hard body parts, shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.3 <a href="#Bio111-03b-fig" id="Bio111-03b-text">below</a>. Remains must be covered by sediment almost immediately. Buried organisms may experience mineralization (occasionally even within cells), or they may decay, leaving a space within the sediment later replaced with rock. Alternative pathways to fossilization include freezing, drying, trapping in resin (amber) or burial in anoxic (oxygen-free) environments. <strong role="strong">Trace fossils</strong> preserve footprints, burrows, droppings, eggs, nests, and other types of impressions. Overall, a great variety of types of fossils reveal the history of life, shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.4 <a href="#Bio11-1-n1-fig" id="Bio11-1-n1-text">below</a>.</p><p>Images in rock tell us what kinds of organisms lived in the past, but the story of life cannot be told without knowing when various organisms appeared. <strong role="strong">Paleontologists</strong> use two methods to date fossils. The oldest method looks at position within a sedimentary column of rock to give a fossil&rsquo;s <strong role="strong">relative age</strong>. If the rock layers are undisturbed, the deepest layers are the oldest, and layers near the surface are the youngest, shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.5 <a href="#Bio11-1-5-fig" id="Bio11-1-5-text">below</a>. Widespread, short-lived <strong role="strong">index fossils</strong> can help identify rock layers of the same age spread around the earth, shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.6 <a href="#Bio111-06-fig" id="Bio111-06-text">below</a>. Combining worldwide observations of relative position and composition resulted in a <strong role="strong">Geologic Time Scale</strong> for the Earth &ndash; a column of rock layers which reflects the history of sedimentary rock formation and changing life, stretching back to a time which apparently held no life. The fossil record showed patterns which, combined with his observations of living species, led Charles Darwin to conclude that all life on Earth descended from a single, simple common ancestor.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2719" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio111-03b-text" id="Bio111-03b-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.3 <caption> was a small dinosaur from Early Cretaceous Italy.

Radioactive decay is a random but exponential process. An isotope&rsquo;s half life gives the time period over which half of the material will decay to a different, relatively stable product, shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.7 <a href="#Bio11-1-n2-fig" id="Bio11-1-n2-text">below</a>. The ratio of the original isotope to its decay product changes in a predictable way. This predictability allows the relative abundances of isotope and decay product to be used as a clock that measures the time from the incorporation of the isotope into a rock or a fossil to the present.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2728" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio111-06-text" id="Bio111-06-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.6 <caption>Single-celled algae serve as index fossils to correlate rock layers located in different states.

Cosmic rays cause the formation of Carbon-14 from the more common and stable Carbon-12 at a relatively constant rate, so carbon dioxide in the atmosphere contains relatively constant, predictable amounts. Organisms acquire carbon from various mechanisms &ndash; plants from CO<sub>2</sub>, and animals and other heterotrophs through food chains. When an organism dies, its carbon intake stops, and existing Carbon-14 atoms decay exponentially, according to their 5,370-year half-life. The proportion of Carbon-14 in the organism&rsquo;s remains indicates the time lapsed since its death.</p><div><p><strong>Table </strong>1.1 </p><table><p></p><thead><tr><td>Isotope</td><td>Decay Product</td><td>Half-life</td><td>Aging of Rocks or Fossils</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Carbon-14</td><td>Nitrogen</td><td>5370 years</td><td>Up to 60,000 years</td></tr><tr><td>Uranium 238/235</td><td>Thorium/Protactinium</td><td>80,000/34,300 years</td><td>Hundreds of thousands of years</td></tr><tr><td>Potassium-40</td><td>Argon</td><td>1.3 billion years</td><td>Earth&rsquo;s oldest rocks</td></tr><tr><td>Uranium-238/235</td><td>Lead</td><td>4.5 billion /704 million years</td><td>1 million to &gt; 4.5 billion years</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Carbon-14 has a relatively short half-life, so its use for absolute dating is limited to a maximum of about 60,000 years.

Uranium-238 and Uranium-235 decay to different isotopes of lead with half-lives of 4.46 billion and 704 million years, respectively, and together allow dating of rocks between 1 million and over 4.5 billion years old. <strong role="strong">Table</strong>  1.1 <a href="#table:Isotopes Used to Measure Absolute Age of Rocks and Fossils-fig" id="table:Isotopes Used to Measure Absolute Age of Rocks and Fossils-text">Isotopes Used to Measure Absolute Age of Rocks and Fossils</a> shows some of the many isotopes can be used to study rocks throughout Earth&rsquo;s 4.6 billion year history.</p><p>Absolute aging techniques confirmed and brought into focus the rock layer story geologists and paleontologists had developed with relative dating. They pushed Earth&rsquo;s history back 4.6 billion years, and showed that complex life evolved after some two billion years in which bacteria alone populated the Earth.</p><p>Further confirmation of common ancestry included <strong role="strong">molecular clocks,</strong> which measure changes in DNA or proteins to indicate degrees of relationship among species. Comparing DNA sequences of several species of primates, for example, shows that chimpanzees are more closely related to humans than are gorillas or baboons, shown in <strong role="strong">Table</strong>  1.2 <a href="#table:DNA Clock Comparison of Primates-fig" id="table:DNA Clock Comparison of Primates-text">DNA Clock Comparison of Primates</a>. If we assume uniform rates of mutation, we can estimate not only degree of relationship, but time back to common ancestry. Because DNA sequences (and mutations) determine the sequence of amino acids in proteins, Hemoglobin and other proteins are also used as &ldquo;clocks.&rdquo; Both DNA and protein clocks support a universal common ancestor for life, confirming the story which continues to unfold as new discoveries expand the fossil record. Molecular clocks, together with evidence from the fossil record, allows scientists to estimate how long ago various groups of organisms diverged evolutionarily from one another.</p><div><p><strong>Table </strong>1.2 </p><table><p></p><thead><tr><td>Species</td><td>% Difference in Nucleotide Sequence,  Compared to Humans</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Human</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Chimpanzee</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Gorilla</td><td>1.6</td></tr><tr><td>Baboon</td><td>6.6</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3>A Geologic Time Scale Measures the Evolution of Life</h3><p>We noted in the previous section that observation of rock layers, dating techniques, and correlation of similar strata from around the world led to the development of a Geologic Time Scale (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.8 <a href="#Bio111-08-fig" id="Bio111-08-text">below</a>). How does the scale divide 4.6 billion years of history? What themes emerge from its stories of the past?</p><p>One theme is almost unimaginable amounts of time. The deep time of Earth&rsquo;s history is far beyond our experience, and our knowledge is far more detailed for recent millennia than for the distant past. A scale divided into evenly spaced periods of time would not show that detail. Instead, Geologic Time Scale divisions mark major events which highlight changes in climate, geography, atmosphere, and life. The largest units of time are <strong role="strong">Eons</strong>. Eons include smaller <strong role="strong">Eras</strong>, which in turn include <strong role="strong">Periods, Epochs</strong>, and <strong role="strong">Stages</strong>. Faunal stages identify specific fossil groups. Terms such as Upper/Late and Lower/Early divide parts of the scale into more recent and more distant subunits.</p><p>Four eons comprise the history of Earth, and their names refer to a second major theme of Earth history: the evolution of life. The Phanerozoic (&ldquo;visible life&rdquo;) Eon spans the most recent 545 million years and includes three Eras well known for their chronicle of life: the oldest Paleozoic, middle Mesozoic, and current Cenozoic. The Proterozoic (&ldquo;before complex life&rdquo;) Eon precedes the Phanerozoic, extending back 2.5 billion years. The Archean (&ldquo;ancient&rdquo;) and Hadean (&ldquo;unseen&rdquo;) Eons reach back to the formation of the Earth. The Precambrian <strong role="strong">Supereon</strong> combines the oldest three eons, and refers to the time before the first great explosion of life recorded in the fossil record - the <strong role="strong">Cambrian</strong> Period. The name &ldquo;Cambrian&rdquo; refers to Wales, where these fossils were first studied. Before this first period of the Phanerozoic, animals lacked hard body parts to contribute to the fossil record.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2756" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio111-08-text" id="Bio111-08-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.8 <caption>A linear arrangement of the Geologic Time Scale shows overall relationships between well-known time periods, which will be used in this and future chapters. Our knowledge of past life is concentrated in the most recent Eon, but the Phanerozoic occupies such a small proportion of the overall history of earth that eras, periods, and epochs are not precisely to scale. For future lessons, relevant parts of the scale will show more detail with greater accuracy.</caption></p></div><p> </p><h3>Patterns and Processes of Macroevolution</h3><p>Throughout geologic time, the fossil record reveals dramatic changes in species and groups of species which have populated the Earth. Evolution at or above the species level is <strong role="strong">macroevolution</strong>, in contrast to <strong role="strong">microevolution</strong>, which describes changes within a species or population. Many scientists no longer emphasize the distinction, believing evolution to be a single process which includes both patterns. However, themes from the Geologic Time Scale illustrate macroevolution, so we will consider its patterns and processes in this chapter.</p><p>Although fossils dated back only to the Cambrian during Darwin&rsquo;s time, radiometric dating has since identified fossil bacteria as old as the beginning of the Archean era 3.5 billion years ago. The geologic record shows over 2 billion years during which the only life was unicellular. The appearance of eukarytoic cells roughly 1.8 billion years ago marked a dramatic increase in cellular complexity. In rocks 1 billion years old, multicellular eukaryotes begin to appear, and by the end of the Precambrian, fossils record a variety of ancient multicellular organisms. The beginning of Cambrian Period marks an &ldquo;explosion&rdquo; of life, and in general, biodiversity has increased throughout the Phanerozoic, shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.9 <a href="#Bio111-08b-fig" id="Bio111-08b-text">below</a>. Our current understanding of the fossil record confirms Darwin&rsquo;s ideas that life began as tiny single-celled bacteria and over vast time evolved to produce the complexity and diversity we celebrate today.</p><p>As recorded in fossils, the evolution of life was not smooth or steady. <strong role="strong">Mass extinctions</strong> and <strong role="strong">episodic speciation</strong> interrupted the overall pattern of increasing biodiversity, shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.9 <a href="#Bio111-08b-fig" id="Bio111-08b-text">below</a>. These disruptions reflect dramatic changes in the environment of the Earth.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2752" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio111-08b-text" id="Bio111-08b-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.9 <caption>Estimates of numbers of marine genera throughout the last 542 million years support a gradual increase in biodiversity, interrupted by five major mass extinctions. Some scientists dispute the accuracy of such estimates, while others argue that they show regular cycles of extinction.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>A major theme of the fossil record is loss of species. The death of a species &ndash; <strong role="strong">extinction</strong> &ndash; seems to be as much a characteristic of life as the death of individual organisms. Both seem closely linked to change in environment. Through mutation or sexual reproduction, offspring show variation. Individuals whose variations are not well suited to their environment die. Those whose variations are adaptive survive to reproduce. Death and differential reproduction result in <strong role="strong">adaptation</strong> to a changing environment.</p><p>These same forces of <strong role="strong">natural selection</strong> inevitably affect species: the fossil record indicates that up to 99.9% of all species that have ever lived on Earth are now extinct. <strong role="strong">Mass extinctions</strong> involve most major groups of organisms over a short period. The past 550 million years, when fossils are sufficiently abundant to tell a reliable story, show five mass extinctions in which more than 50% of animal species died. The most famous is the extinction which ended the reign of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. Accelerated evolution may follow mass extinction, because the empty ecological niches make way for new species. After the non-birdlike dinosaurs disappeared, mammals rapidly evolved to fill the available niches. The fossil record shows numerous examples of <strong role="strong">episodic speciation</strong>, a pattern of periodic increase which includes these rebounds as well as bursts of evolution following major new &ldquo;discoveries&rdquo; or &ldquo;ideas&rdquo; &ndash; for example, the biochemical pathways for photosynthesis or cellular respiration.</p><p>Closely related to mass extinction is the theme of major environmental change throughout Earth&rsquo;s history. Rock layers reflect critical changes in atmosphere and climate: oxidized iron deposits mark the introduction of oxygen gas to the atmosphere, and glacial deposits reflect periodic ice ages alternating with times of global warming. Craters and unique worldwide strata suggest that spectacular asteroid or comet collisions may have severely reduced solar radiation, and lava flows and ash suggests volcanism could have done the same. Massive geographic changes, now explained by <strong role="strong">plate tectonics theory</strong>, underlie volcanism as well as formation of new land bridges, seaways, and continents. Certain worldwide sedimentary deposits suggest significant sea level fluctuation, which may result from some of the aforementioned climate or plate tectonic changes. Life evolved against the backdrop of these often-catastrophic changes, and over 3.5 billion years of natural selection inevitably responded to them. Many of these changes are believed to have caused the mass extinctions and episodic speciation revealed in the fossil record. We will look at some of these events in more detail in the next two lessons.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2718" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio111-09b-text" id="Bio111-09b-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.10 <caption>Two theories of evolutionary change - gradualism vs. punctuated equilibrium - are still debated. The former proposes continuous change, while the latter suggests that species remain constant for long periods of time and that change, when it occurs, is rapid.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>Two caveats are critical in interpreting the history of life using the Geologic Time Scale. The first concerns the idea that evolution progresses via slow, steady, gradual change. We have already seen that mass extinction and episodic speciation interrupt the overall pattern of increasing biodiversity, but <strong role="strong">gradualism</strong> suggests that changes accumulate continuously as one species evolves to become another. An alternative, more recent theory, <strong role="strong">punctuated equilibrium</strong>, shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.10 <a href="#Bio111-09b-fig" id="Bio111-09b-text">above</a>, proposes that species remain the same for long periods, and that change occurs infrequently but rather rapidly under unusual conditions such as geographic isolation or migration. The rather sudden appearance and disappearance of many individual species within the fossil record, noted even by Darwin, tends to support the latter theory. The idea of <strong role="strong">quantum evolution</strong> attempts to explain the origins of major groups (families, orders, and classes) as a response to drastic changes in environment or adaptive zones. The fossil record supports great variation in the rate of evolutionary change - from group to group and even among closely related lineages. Each of these ideas about pattern and rate may accurately describe one of many ways evolution works.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2720" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio111-11-text" id="Bio111-11-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.11 <caption>Charles Darwin's 1837 sketch from his First Notebook on Transmutation of Species (1837), shows the bush-like pattern of evolution.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>A second caveat: the 4.6 billion year time scale makes it tempting to view evolution as linear, and perhaps even goal-directed. Time may be an arrow, but evolution is much more a bush of common ancestry&ndash;a family tree, as we saw at the beginning of the chapter. Darwin recognized this - his sketch, shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.11 <a href="#Bio111-11-fig" id="Bio111-11-text">above</a>, shows the pattern of speciation predicted by his theory of chance variation and adaptive selection. A very recent (August 2007) discovery encourages us to view our own human ancestry as a bush rather than a line. Radiometric dating of a new fossil of <em>Homo habilis</em> shows that this species coexisted with the "more advanced" Homo erectus, shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.12 <a href="#Bio11-1-12-fig" id="Bio11-1-12-text">below</a>. Previously, scientists considered the former an ancestor of the latter. The inappropriate expression &ldquo;more advanced&rdquo; implies the false, linear, goal-directed interpretation of evolution.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2764" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio11-1-12-text" id="Bio11-1-12-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.12 <caption>Homo habilis (left) was considered an ancestor to Homo erectus (right) until the 2007 discovery of a habilis fossil which showed that the two species coexisted.

Mass extinctions (the dinosaurs!), new volcanic islands (the Galapagos, or Hawaii), land bridge formation (the isthmus between North and South America) or &ldquo;invention&rdquo; of a new idea in evolution &ndash; all are events which &ldquo;suddenly&rdquo; open a variety of niches for adaptive radiation. In each case, a fundamental structure in one species is modified to serve new functions in different environments or modes of life. For example, forelimbs of mammals have become elongated with grasping hands for the forested habitats of monkeys, flattened into flippers for the aquatic habitats of whales, and spread into wings for the aerial habitats of bats, shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.13 <a href="#Bio11-01-13-fig" id="Bio11-01-13-text">below</a>. Adaptive radiation explains &ndash; and the fossil record shows &ndash; that these groups all arose from one ancestor or a small group of common ancestors.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2751" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio11-01-13-text" id="Bio11-01-13-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.13 <caption>Forelimbs of mammals show adaptive radiation, or divergent evolution.

This pattern surfaces frequently in the history of life when different organisms occupy similar ecological niches. For example, three major groups of organisms have evolved wings for flight: reptiles (pterosaurs), birds, and mammals (bats), shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.14 <a href="#Bio11-01-14-fig" id="Bio11-01-14-text">below</a>.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2749" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio11-01-14-text" id="Bio11-01-14-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.14 <caption>The wings of pterosaurs (1), bats (2) and birds (3) show convergent evolution.

Mammals evolved in the northern hemisphere and migrated to Australia across a land bridge (see A, above) which was later submerged (B). Marsupials persisted and underwent adaptive radiation in Australia. Elsewhere, the appearance of placental mammals spelled doom for the marsupials; placental mammals outcompeted them and underwent their own adaptive radiations. These separate radiations (green, orange, and red in B) resulted in a number of examples of convergent evolution.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>Australian fauna reveal both divergent and convergent patterns related to major geographical change, shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.15 <a href="#Bio11-1-15-fig" id="Bio11-1-15-text">above</a>. Major groups of mammals evolved in the northern hemisphere and migrated to Australia across a land bridge. Later submerging of the land bridge isolated the Australian mammals, and the marsupials underwent their own adaptive radiation within their insular continent. Elsewhere, placental mammals evolved to out-compete the more primitive monotremes and marsupials, and underwent their own adaptive radiation. These independent radiations resulted in some wonderful examples of convergent evolution: An example: the marsupial Tasmanian wolf (now extinct) shared with the placental canines many adaptations to life as a hunting predator, shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.16 <a href="#Bio11-1-16-fig" id="Bio11-1-16-text">below</a>.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2715" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio11-1-16-text" id="Bio11-1-16-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.16 <caption>The thylacine or Tasmanian wolf, a marsupial, closely resembles the golden jackal, a placental canine; both show similar adaptations to predatory life, demonstrating convergent evolution. Marsupials and placentals evolved independently due to the loss of a land bridge connecting Australia to southeast Asia, so they provide examples of convergent evolution.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>One last, fascinating pattern within the history of life is <strong role="strong">coevolution</strong>. In coevolution, two species or groups of species influence each other&rsquo;s evolution and therefore evolve in tandem. Relationships may be positive for one species or both, or an evolutionary arms race between predator and prey. Flowering plants depend on insects for pollination, so have evolved colors, shapes, scents, and even food supplies which are attractive to certain insect species. Insects, in turn, have evolved mouthparts, senses, and flight patterns which allow them to respond to and benefit from specific floral &ldquo;offerings,&rdquo; shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.17 <a href="#Bio111-17-fig" id="Bio111-17-text">below</a>. The <strong role="strong">Endosymbiotic Theory</strong> describes a special form of co-evolution: Mitochondria and chloroplasts evolve within eukaryote cells, yet because these organelles have their own DNA sequence, different from that of the nucleus in the &ldquo;host&rdquo; cell, organelle and host cell evolve in tandem &ndash; each influences the evolution of the other.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2716" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio111-17-text" id="Bio111-17-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.17 <caption>Impressive proboscis and vivid colors! Hawk moths and the zinneas influence each others evolution, because the flower depends on the moth for pollination, and the moth feeds on the flower.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>Closely related to coevolution is <strong role="strong">coextinction</strong>. If one member of a pair of interdependent species becomes extinct, the other is likely to follow. Famous examples were two species of bird lice which were obligate parasites on the passenger pigeon, shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.18 <a href="#Bio11-1-18-fig" id="Bio11-1-18-text">below</a>. When &ldquo;Martha,&rdquo; a resident at the Cincinnati Zoo thought to be the last passenger pigeon in the world died on September 1, 1914, the extinction of the bird lice species followed. Alas, one louse species was later rediscovered on a band-tailed pigeon, and the other species had been misidentified.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2745" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio11-1-18-text" id="Bio11-1-18-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.18 <caption>The passenger pigeon and a parasitic species of louse (not the one pictured above) demonstrate coevolution and potential coextinction. Each species influenced the others evolution, and when the host became extinct in 1914, the parasite narrowly escaped extinction only because an alternate host  the band-tailed pigeon  survived.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>In this lesson, you have explored the tools we use to study the history of life, the Geologic Time Scale which organizes what we know, and a variety of patterns found in the 4.6 billion year story. In the next lessons, look for examples of these patterns as we follow that story from the origin of life to what is becoming known as the Sixth Extinction today.</p><h3>Lesson Summary</h3><ul><li>If the history of life is condensed into a single 24-hour &ldquo;cosmological day,&rdquo; humans occupy only the last minute and one-half, and civilization, less than the final second. </li><li>Fossils include mineralized remains of organisms, casts, impressions, footprints, burrows, droppings, eggs, or nests as well as frozen, dried, or amber-coated remains. </li><li>The positions of fossils in rocks indicate their relative ages; older fossils and rock layers are deeper than fossils and rocks that are more recent. </li><li>Radiometric dating measures the proportion of decay products of radioisotopes with known half-lives to estimate absolute age. Different isotopes with a range of half-lives cover the span of geologic time. </li><li>Comparing DNA or protein in similar species can reveal evolutionary relationships and confirm patterns suggested by the fossil record. </li><li>Geologic Time Scale divisions mark major events which highlight changes in climate, geography, atmosphere, and life. </li><li>The largest units of time are Eons; the 4.6 billion years of earth&rsquo;s history are divided into four eons. </li><li>The Phanerozoic includes the most recent 545 million years and the most detailed fossil record. </li><li>Overall, the fossil record confirms Darwin&rsquo;s idea that life began as tiny single-celled bacteria and over time evolved to produce the complexity and diversity we celebrate today. </li><li>Mass extinctions and episodic speciation interrupt an overall gradual increase in complexity and diversity. </li><li>Evolution shows response to major environmental changes, including volcanism, continental drift, sustained warming and cooling, asteroid impact, and critical transformations of earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. </li><li>The rate of evolution is not always uniform; gradualism does not characterize all speciation. </li><li>The pattern of evolution is seldom linear, but rather more like a bush or family tree. </li><li>Punctuated equilibrium, quantum evolution, and variable rates describe patterns of evolution which may differ from gradualism. </li><li>In divergent evolution, also called adaptive radiation, closely related species evolve different traits to adapt to a variety of available niches. </li><li>In convergent evolution, distantly related species evolve similar traits as adaptations to similar habitats. </li><li>Geographic changes, including continental drift, affect patterns of evolution. </li></ul><h3>Review Questions</h3><ol start><li>How do the conditions needed for fossilization explain the rarity of fossils?</li><li>Compare relative dating of fossils and rock layers to absolute dating.</li><li>Explain why &ldquo;carbon dating&rdquo; is an inadequate description of aging rocks and fossils.</li><li>Describe how molecular clocks clarify evolutionary relationships.</li><li>Compare and contrast Geologic Time with absolute time, including the limits of each.</li><li>Explain the ways in which the Geologic Time Scale and the fossils it records may be misleading concerning the history of life.</li><li>Construct a table or chart which shows five of the major patterns of macroevolution we have observed in the fossil record. Include the pattern name, a brief description or definition, causes or contributing factors (where applicable), and a specific example for each.</li><li>Explain how some of the patterns of evolution and environmental change account for worldwide differences in the distribution of mammals. Discuss placentals vs. marsupials.</li><li>Charles Darwin described an orchid from Madagascar that had a nectar well which measured 12 inches deep, keeping costly sugars far out of reach of all known butterflies and moths. He predicted the existence of a highly specialized pollinator moth with a foot-long proboscis that could act as a straw to reach the nectar. After Darwin&rsquo;s death, scientists discovered a night-flying moth that matched Darwin&rsquo;s expectation and named it the &ldquo;Predicta.&rdquo; Which pattern of evolution did Darwin see in the orchid? Explain why this is a good example of the pattern.</li><li>Relate human history to life&rsquo;s history, as shown in the Geologic Time Scale and fossil record.</li></ol><h3>Further Reading / Supplemental Links</h3><ul><li>Colleen Whitney, Kate Barton, David Smith, &ldquo;The Paleontology Portal.&rdquo; University of California Museum of Paleontology, Paleontological Society, Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, and US Geological Survey, 2003.

These range from fossils &ndash; the actual remnants of living organisms &ndash; to comparisons of molecules within organisms still living today. Which tools do you consider most reliable? Does the fact that the information from one set of tools often confirms that evidence collected using a different set of tools strengthen your acceptance of the data? </li><li>Review the various patterns of macroevolution, from mass extinction to coevolution and coextinction. Which of these best support the depiction of evolution as a bush, rather than an arrow? Which support the idea that evolution builds on what already exists, so the more variety there is, the more there can be in the future? </li></ul>
