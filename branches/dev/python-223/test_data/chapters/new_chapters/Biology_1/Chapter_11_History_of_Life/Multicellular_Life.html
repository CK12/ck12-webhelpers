Not until nearly 80% of Earth&rsquo;s history had passed did multicellular life evolve. The fossil record tells the story: millions of species of fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals, mosses, ferns, conifers, flowering plants, and fungi populated the seas and covered the Earth - as continents crashed together and broke apart, glaciers advanced and retreated, and meteors struck, causing massive extinctions. Life has had a colorful and exciting last billion years, spawning diversity almost beyond our comprehension.</p><p>And yet, the giant steps of evolution remain back in the Precambrian. Its catalog of evolutionary innovations is long and impressive:</p><ul><li>Energized elements from stardust formed simple organic molecules. </li><li>Building blocks chained together to form catalysts and self-replicating macromolecules. </li><li>Biochemical pathways evolved. </li><li>Protective yet permeable membranes enclosed the catalysts, replicators and their metabolic retinue. </li><li>Early prokaryotic cells &ldquo;learned&rdquo; to make ATP by splitting glucose. </li><li>Others began to harvest sunlight energy through photosynthesis. </li><li>Photosynthetic cyanobacteria produced vast amounts of &ldquo;waste&rdquo; oxygen, dramatically altering the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. </li><li>The oceans rusted (iron ore deposits). </li><li>An ozone layer formed, shielding life from UV radiation. </li><li>The &ldquo;O<sub>2</sub> catastrophe&rdquo; killed many anaerobic prokaryotes. </li><li>Still other prokaryotes &ldquo;learned&rdquo; to use the new O<sub>2</sub> to release the energy remaining in carbohydrates products of glycolysis. </li><li>Endosymbiosis created eukaryotes, firmly establishing the three major evolutionary lineages, which yet today comprise the living world. </li></ul><p>The timing and exact nature of most of these innovations is speculative; indeed, the first few may have been extraterrestrial and even deeper in time. They comprise perhaps the most important landmarks in the evolution of life, but the fossil record is sketchy due to prokaryote size, rock layer metamorphosis, and burial by more recent rocks.</p><p>Overall, we know remarkably little about Precambrian life. The <strong role="strong">Cambrian Period</strong> documents the greatest flowering of life of all time, and gives its name - in a rather negative sense - to the 4 billion years of Earth history that preceded it. Before we dive into the famous Cambrian &ldquo;explosion,&rdquo; we will look more carefully at the last Eon of the Precambrian, which set the stage for this most famous burst of evolution.</p><h3>Late Precambrian: Setting the Stage for an Explosion of Biodiversity</h3><p>The geologic record of the Proterozoic, the most recent eon of the Precambrian, is much better than that of the Archean and Hadean Eons before it. Accordingly, we know that <strong role="strong">supercontinents</strong> formed by collision and broke apart by rifting. The atmosphere changed dramatically with the addition of oxygen and a protective ozone layer. Glaciations covered much of the Earth with ice so extensively that it is known as the <strong role="strong">&ldquo;Snowball Earth&rdquo;</strong> during that period (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.26 <a href="#Bio113-01-fig" id="Bio113-01-text">below</a>). Eventually, enough CO<sub>2</sub> escaped from volcanoes to begin a period of global warming; melting opened a great variety of new niches. The severe restriction and subsequent opening of opportunities may have driven the later Cambrian explosion.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2761" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio113-01-text" id="Bio113-01-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.26 <caption>The geologic record documents at least two ice ages during the last eon of the Precambrian.

The icy constriction of life and later meltdown opening of niches may have contributed to the explosive evolution of the Ediacaran and Cambrian Periods that followed.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>Within this dramatic environmental panorama, the three major lineages of life &ndash; Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryotes continued to diversify. Plant, animal, and fungal ancestors diverged as solitary cells. Gradually, some of these cells began to live in colonies. Within the colonies, primitive <strong role="strong">specialization</strong> among cells made certain tasks more efficient. The modern green alga, <em>Volvox</em> illustrates a comparable level of organization (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.27 <a href="#Bio11-3-2-fig" id="Bio11-3-2-text">below</a>). The line between colonies and multicellular organisms is difficult to draw, but most scientists agree that true plants had evolved by about 1 billion years ago, and animals evolved about 100 million years later.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2724" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio11-3-2-text" id="Bio11-3-2-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.27 <caption>The green alga  shows the multicellularity and early cell specialization which probably characterized early colonial eukaryotes.

The oxygen atmosphere and/or an ice age may explain their initial radiation. Their abrupt and nearly complete disappearance may have resulted from unbalanced predation, grazing, or competition, or yet another environmental crisis such as supercontinent breakup, changes in ocean chemistry, and/or rising sea levels. Whatever the causes, most species disappeared by the end of the Precambrian, about 542 million years ago. The Ediacarans appear to have been an early multicellular, dead-end branch on the bush of life. Their extinction, however, appears to have paved the way for a spectacular evolution of much more familiar life, which marks the beginning of the modern Phanerozoic Eon: the Cambrian explosion.</p><h3>Paleozoic Era: Ancient Plants and Animals, but Seeds of Modern Life</h3><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2754" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio113-d1-text" id="Bio113-d1-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.30 </p></div><p> </p><p>The Paleozoic era of the current, Phanerozoic Eon is the first concrete chapter of life&rsquo;s history (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.30 <a href="#Bio113-d1-fig" id="Bio113-d1-text">above</a>). Abundant fossils, clearly related to modern animals, plants and fungi, illuminate the path of evolution beginning with its first Period, the Cambrian, 542 million years ago. However, the sudden appearance of such variety presents yet another puzzle in the story of life: how did roughly 50 major groups of organisms evolve so rapidly, without apparent ancestors? The abrupt emergence of so many phyla has given this period in geologic time its nickname, the <strong role="strong">Cambrian explosion</strong>, but its causes remain hypothetical. As for the Ediacaran radiation, major environmental changes have been proposed but not convincingly documented. A major geologic event of the Paleozoic is the amalgamation of the supercontinent Gondwana, but it does not seem to explain the extent of the increase in Cambrian diversity. Perhaps life itself was responsible: a &ldquo;critical mass&rdquo; of development could have opened up new body pattern options, or more kinds of life opened more kinds of ecological niches. Whatever the cause, the evidence shows that nearly all modern animal phyla, including our own chordate phylum, are represented in this diversity of life. Among the most common and famous are reef-building sponges and arthropods, known as <strong role="strong">trilobites</strong> (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.31 <a href="#Bio11-3-5-fig" id="Bio11-3-5-text">below</a>).

The Ice Age affected marine genera severely; up to 60% disappeared! This major extinction marks the end of the Ordovician and the beginning of the <strong role="strong">Silurian Period</strong>.</p><p>During the Silurian, the glaciers retreated. Melting icecaps raised sea level, yet a new supercontinent, Euramerica, formed near the equator. In a long, stable greenhouse phase, warm shallow seas covered extensive equatorial landmasses, opening tropical habitats on land and in water:</p><ul><li>Reef-building corals and sea-scorpions evolved. </li><li>The first jawed fishes joined armored jawless fishes and many invertebrates. </li><li>Vascular plants solved the problem of carrying water into the air. </li><li>Arthropods such as millipedes followed the plants onto land. </li></ul><p>The Silurian ended about 416 million years ago with a minor extinction, which may have been due to an asteroid impact or increasing glaciation.</p><p>During the <strong role="strong">Devonian Period</strong>, terrestrial life expanded to include forests of clubmosses, horsetails, ferns, and the earliest seed-bearing plants and trees (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.34 <a href="#Bio11-3-n11-fig" id="Bio11-3-n11-text">below</a>).</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2725" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio11-3-n11-text" id="Bio11-3-n11-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.34 <caption>Devonian fish (above, left) evolved lobes which eventually allowed vertebrates to move to land.

One hypothesis suggests that the greening of the continents absorbed CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere, reducing the greenhouse effect and lowering temperatures.</p><p>Extensive coal deposits, fuel for our Industrial Revolution, characterize rocks of the <strong role="strong">Carboniferous Period</strong> which followed. Coal developed from new bark-bearing trees in widespread lowland swamps and forests. Fallen trees were buried without decaying &ndash; perhaps because animals and bacteria had not yet evolved digestive enzymes that could break down the new molecule, lignin, in the wood. Burial of carbon lead to a corresponding buildup of oxygen in the atmosphere; O<sub>2</sub> at the time was an all-time high of 35% (compared to 21% today). Abundant oxygen probably encouraged evolution, especially on land.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2753" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio11-3-n12-text" id="Bio11-3-n12-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.35 <caption>Vertebrates moved to land during the Carboniferous, and amphibians became abundant.

If we look more closely at the effects of continental geography on climate, perhaps we can begin to understand not only that massive extinction, but also the major events in evolution which preceded it. During the Permian, all the major landmasses of earth combined into a single supercontinent, known as <strong role="strong">Pangaea</strong> (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.36 <a href="#Bio11-3-10-fig" id="Bio11-3-10-text">below</a>). As for today&rsquo;s continents, much of the interior would have been dry with seasons of temperature change, because the oceans&rsquo; moderating effects were too distant. Pangaea&rsquo;s size may have exaggerated this continental climate of seasons and drought. Three major groups of animals and plants evolved in response to Pangaea&rsquo;s extensive arid niches.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2743" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio11-3-10-text" id="Bio11-3-10-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.36 <caption>The supercontinent Pangaea encompassed all of todays continents in a single land mass. This configuration limited shallow coastal areas which harbor marine species, and may have contributed to the dramatic event which ended the Permian - the most massive extinction ever recorded.</caption></p></div><p> </p><ul><li>Reptiles, with claws, scaly skin, and shelled eggs, diversified, foreshadowing Mesozoic dinosaurs. </li><li>Cycads and other gymnosperms, with cuticle-covered leaves to limit water loss and cones to bear seeds, dominated forests. </li><li>Insects evolved entire life cycles on dry land; beetles and flies navigated land and air. </li></ul><p>At the end of the Permian, an estimated 99.5% of individual organisms perished. Several factors may have contributed, and one factor relates again to Pangaea. Marine biodiversity is greatest in shallow coastal areas. A single continent has a much smaller shoreline than multiple continents of the same size. Perhaps this restriction of marine habitats contributed to the drastic loss of species, for up to 95% of marine species perished, compared to &ldquo;only&rdquo; 70% of land species. Another factor might have been massive basalt flow attributed to the time, which could have increased CO<sub>2</sub> levels to precipitate global warming. Some scientists invoke extraterrestrial causes: a huge meteorite crater discovered in 2006 in Antarctica and dated to between 100 and 500 million years ago could represent an impact which darkened skies, decreased sunlight, and shut down photosynthesis. Although the cause remains unknown, fossils clearly document the fact of Earth&rsquo;s most devastating extinction. The event closed the Paleozoic Era, and inevitably opened the door to a new burst of life in the Mesozoic.</p><h3>Mesozoic Era: Age of the Dinosaurs</h3><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2755" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio11-03header3-text" id="Bio11-03header3-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.37 </p></div><p> </p><p>Following the &ldquo;great dying&rdquo; at the end of the Permian, a resurgence of evolution in the Mesozoic established the basis of modern life (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.37 <a href="#Bio11-03header3-fig" id="Bio11-03header3-text">above</a>).

Dinosaurs had begun to decline earlier, perhaps due to reduction in atmospheric oxygen and global cooling. A worldwide iridium-rich layer, dated at 65.5 million years ago, provides evidence for an additional, more dramatic cause for their ultimate extinction. Iridium is rare in the Earth&rsquo;s crust, but common in comets and asteroids. Scientists correlate this layer with a huge crater in the Yucatan and Gulf of Mexico. A collision/explosion between the Earth and a comet or asteroid could have spread debris which set off tsunamis, altered the climate (including acid rain), and reduced sunlight 10-20%. A consequent reduction in photosynthesis would have caused a drastic disruption in food chains.

Let&rsquo;s look at some of the major events, focusing not only on our immediate ancestors but also on the world in which they evolved. More detailed stories of the evolution of humans and other groups will be told in later chapters.</p><p>Seven Epochs comprise the Cenozoic Era, with the Holocene continuing up to today. &ldquo;Tertiary&rdquo; refers to the 64 million years and five epochs before the Quaternary Period, well known for its recent ice ages and recognizable humans.

CO<sub>2</sub> from either volcanism or oxidation of methane would have caused the oceans to become more acidic, and Earth&rsquo;s temperatures to rise. Warm temperatures allowed forests of dawn redwood, swamp cypress, and palms to extend toward both poles. In the interiors of the continents, seasonal temperature and moisture variations led to the evolution of grasses, expansive savannas and deciduous forests. Within these new ecosystems, modern mammals with specialized teeth evolved. Probably due to high temperatures, these mammals were smaller than those who preceded them &ndash; or those who followed:</p><ul><li>Horses and tapirs evolved in North America, and rhinoceros evolved in Asia. </li><li>Primates, with their long arms and legs and grasping hands and feet, appeared. </li><li>Mammals returned to the sea; <em>Basilosaurus</em> was an ancestor of today&rsquo;s whales.</li></ul><p>At the beginning of the Eocene, Australia was still connected to Antarctica, but when they broke apart, ocean currents changed and cooling began in earnest, foreshadowing the ice ages to come. Tundra ecosystems developed near the poles.

Modern mammals, including wolves, beaver, deer, camels, seals, dolphins, and porpoises, evolved. Up to 100 species of apes lived throughout Africa, Europe, and Asia. Almost all modern bird groups were represented.</p><p>The Earth&rsquo;s climate continued to cool into the <strong role="strong">Pliocene</strong>, the epoch in which hominids first appeared.

Into this setting walked Australopithecines, such as <strong role="strong">Lucy</strong> who share common ancestry with humans.

Permafrosts have preserved nearly 40 mammoth remains, including soft tissues, and scientists actually hope to be able to recreate its genome; mitochondrial DNA for one species has already been sequenced!

Giant insects, early gymnosperms with pollen, and vertebrates with shelled eggs colonized dry land. </li><li>During the Permian, all the major landmasses of earth combined into a single supercontinent, Pangaea. A continental climate of seasons and drought favored reptiles, gymnosperms, and insects such as beetles. The Permian ended with the most massive extinction of all time; 99.5% of all species disappeared, opening the door for a new radiation of species in the Mesozoic. </li><li>The Permian extinction, stable temperatures and continental breakup created niches for a great radiation of life in the Triassic Period. Reptiles diversified &ndash; on land as the archosaurs, in the air as pterosaurs, and in the seas as ichthyosaurs. Other reptilian lines gave rise to early turtles, crocodiles, and finally, mammals and birds. </li><li>During the Cretaceous, primitive birds began to radiate and out-compete the pterosaurs; dinosaurs reached their largest size and greatest diversity. </li><li>Record-high temperatures during the Eocene made way for hoofed animals and primates within grasslands, savannas, and deciduous and coniferous forests. </li><li><em>Australopithecus</em>, perhaps the earliest, upright hominid, appeared during the Pliocene. Global cooling and glaciation led to a drop in sea level, exposing two land bridges which allowed important animal migrations. </li><li>Cycles of glaciation stressed Pleistocene animals and plants; some, like the woolly mammoth, adapted to cold and others, like <em>Homo erectus</em>, the dominant hominid, migrated throughout Africa, Europe, and Asia. </li><li>As the human population climbs above 6.6 billion, we may be causing a Sixth Extinction of life on Earth. </li></ul><h3>Review Questions</h3><ol start><li>What major evolutionary steps followed the evolution of the first eukaryotic cell during the late Precambrian to set the stage for the &ldquo;Cambrian explosion?&rdquo;</li><li>List the global environmental factors which influenced the evolution of multicellular life.</li><li>Discuss and give examples of the relationships among the environmental factors you listed above.

What are some of the answers our current knowledge gives us? What points are still missing? </li><li>To what extent has life itself influenced the history of life on Earth? Consider some specific effects certain kinds of life have had on climate, the atmosphere, and certain species. </li><li>At least some mammoth DNA has been preserved in permafrost. What do you think about the idea of re-creating animals such as the mammoth from the past &ndash; as fictionalized in Jurassic Park? </li><li>Do you think extinction plays an essential role in evolution? Is it a negative or positive role? </li><li>Do you judge the Sixth Extinction to be an important problem? Do you think it is significantly different from earlier extinctions? </li></ul>
