<h2>Lesson 24.4: Environmental Problems and Human Health</h2><h3>Lesson Objectives</h3><ul><li>Explain how carcinogens cause cancer and list ways that cancer can be treated or prevented. </li><li>Identify causes of air pollution and describe how air pollution affects human health. </li><li>Define bioterrorism and explain how bioterrorism threatens human health. </li></ul><h3>Introduction</h3><p>Cancer is one of many human diseases that can be caused by environmental problems. For example, air pollution may increase the risk of lung cancer. It can also cause or worsen asthma, cardiovascular diseases, and other health problems. Bioterrorism is another potential threat to human health. It may lead to severe environmental problems that have the potential to poison large numbers of people or cause epidemics of deadly diseases.</p><h3>Carcinogens and Cancer</h3><p>A carcinogen is anything that can cause cancer. Cancer is a disease in which abnormal body cells divide of control. Most carcinogens cause cancer by inducing mutations.</p><h4>Carcinogens</h4><p>Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemical substances, or radiation. Carcinogens often occur in nature. For example, some viruses are important carcinogens, causing as many as 15 percent of all human cancers. Different viruses cause different cancers. The human papilloma virus (HPV) is the main cause of cancer of the cervix in females. The hepatitis B virus can cause liver cancer, and the Epstein-Barr virus can cause cancer of the lymph nodes.</p><p>Other natural carcinogens include ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. UV radiation is the leading cause of skin cancer. Radon is a natural radioactive gas that seeps into buildings from the ground. Exposure to radon can cause lung cancer. Asbestos can also cause lung cancer. Asbestos is a mineral previously used for insulation and many other purposes. Today, it is largely banned because of its link to cancer.</p><p>Humans are exposed to many artificial carcinogens in the environment, including those in tobacco smoke. In fact, tobacco smoke may be the key source of human carcinogen exposure. It contains dozens of carcinogens including nicotine and formaldehyde, which is used to preserve dead bodies. As you will read below, other pollutants in the air can cause cancer as well.</p><p>Other artificial carcinogens are or were found in foods. Some food additives, such as certain food dyes, have proven to be carcinogens. Cooking foods at very high temperatures also causes carcinogens to form. For example, a carcinogen called acrylamide forms when carbohydrates are cooked at very high temperatures. It is found in foods such as French fries and potato chips. Barbecued or broiled meats also contain several carcinogens.</p><h4>How Cancer Occurs</h4><p>Carcinogens generally cause cancer by inducing mutations in genes that control cell division or other aspects of the cell cycle. The mutations typically occur in two types of genes: tumor-suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes (see chapter titled <em>Molecular Genetics</em>). Briefly:</p><ul><li>Tumor-suppressor genes are genes that normally repair damaged DNA or prevent cells with badly damaged DNA from dividing (<strong role="strong">Figure A</strong>  1.14 <a href="#Bio394-01-fig" id="Bio394-01-text">below</a>). If mutations occur in these genes, they may no longer be able to prevent cells with damaged DNA from dividing (<strong role="strong">Figure B</strong>  1.14 <a href="#Bio394-01-fig" id="Bio394-01-text">below</a>). </li><li>Proto-oncogenes are genes that normally help regulate cell division. Mutations can turn them into oncogenes. Oncogenes are abnormal genes that stimulate the division of cells with damaged DNA. </li></ul><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=3186" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio394-01-text" id="Bio394-01-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.14 <caption>A cell with damaged DNA normally is not allowed to divide, so the damage is not passed on to other cells.  If a cell with damaged DNA is allowed to divide, it results in many more damaged cells.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>Cells that divide uncontrollably form a tumor. A tumor is an abnormal mass of tissue. Tumors may be benign or malignant. Benign tumors remain localized and generally do not harm health. Malignant tumors are cancer. There are no limits on their growth, so they can invade and damage neighboring tissues. Cells from malignant tumors can also break away from the tumor, enter the circulation, and start growing in another part of the body. This is called metastasis.</p><h4>Types of Cancer</h4><p>Cancer is usually classified according to the type of tissue where the cancer begins. Common types of cancer include:</p><ul><li><strong role="strong">Carcinoma</strong>: tumor of epithelial tissues, such as lung tissue. </li><li><strong role="strong">Sarcoma</strong>: tumor of connective tissues, such as bone. </li><li><strong role="strong">Lymphoma</strong>: tumor of lymphatic cells, such as T cells.</li></ul><p>Specific cancers are generally named for the organs where the cancers begin. Relatively common cancers include lung, prostate, bladder, and breast cancers.  These and several other cancers are listed in the <strong role="strong">Table</strong>  1.2 <a href="#table:common_cancers-fig" id="table:common_cancers-text">below</a>. The figure shows which cancers are most common and which cause the most deaths in U.S. adults.</p><div><p><strong>Table </strong>1.2 </p><table><p>Common Cancers among Adult Males and Females in the United States</p><thead><tr><td>Adult Males</td><td> </td><td>Adult Females</td><td> </td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Most Common Cancers (percent of all cancers)</td><td>Most Common Causes of Cancer Deaths (percent of all cancer deaths)</td><td>Most Common Cancers (percent of all cancers)</td><td>Most Common Causes of Cancer Deaths (percent of all cancer deaths)</td></tr><tr><td>Prostate cancer(33%)</td><td>Lung cancer(31%)</td><td>Breast cancer(32%)</td><td>Lung cancer(27%)</td></tr><tr><td>Lung cancer(13%)</td><td>Prostate cancer(10%)</td><td>Lung cancer(12%)</td><td>Breast cancer(15%)</td></tr><tr><td>Colorectal cancer(10%)</td><td>Colorectal cancer(10%)</td><td>Colorectal cancer(11%)</td><td>Colorectal cancer(10%)</td></tr><tr><td>Bladder cancer(7%)</td><td>Pancreatic cancer(5%)</td><td>Endometrial cancer(6%)</td><td>Ovarian cancer(6%)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>(<em>Source:</em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer,">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer,</a> <em>License:</em> Creative Commons)</p><p>Cancer can also occur in children and teens, but it is rare. Most childhood cancers occur during the first year of life. The most common type of infant cancer is leukemia. It makes up about 30 percent of cancers at this age. With prompt treatment, there is a good chance that an infant with cancer will survive.</p><h4>Cancer Treatment and Prevention</h4><p>Most cancers can be treated and some can be cured. The general goal of treatment is to remove the tumor without damaging the rest of the body. Cancer may be treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation. In the past, chemotherapy drugs caused serious side effects. Many of today&rsquo;s chemotherapy drugs target specific molecules in tumors. This reduces damage to normal body cells and causes fewer side effects.</p><p>The outcome of cancer treatment depends on factors such as the type of cancer and its stage. The stage of cancer refers to the extent to which the cancer has developed. Generally, early diagnosis and treatment lead to the best chances of survival. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important for people to be aware of the following warning signs of cancer:</p><ul><li>A change in bowel or bladder habits </li><li>A sore that does not heal </li><li>Unusual bleeding or discharge from any place </li><li>A lump in the breast or other parts of the body </li><li>Chronic indigestion or difficulty in swallowing </li><li>Obvious changes in a wart or mole </li><li>Persistent coughing or hoarseness </li></ul><p>Having warning signs of cancer does not mean that you have cancer, but you should see a doctor to be sure. Getting recommended tests for particular cancers, such as colonoscopies for colon cancer, can also help detect cancers early, when chances of a cure are greatest.</p><p>Many cancers can be prevented, or at least their risk can be reduced. You can help reduce your risk of cancer by avoiding specific carcinogens and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Carcinogens you can avoid or limit your exposure to include tobacco smoke, sexually transmitted viruses, improperly cooked foods, and UV radiation. Other lifestyle choices you can make to reduce your risk of cancer include being physically active, eating a low-fat diet, and maintaining a normal weight.</p><h3>Air Pollution and Illness</h3><p>An estimated 4.6 million people die each year because of air pollution. Worldwide, air pollution causes more deaths than traffic accidents do. Air pollution harms the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Both outdoor and indoor air can be polluted and contribute to illness and death.</p><h4>Outdoor Air Pollution</h4><p>The concentration of pollutants in outdoor air is indicated by the Air Quality Index. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a measure of certain pollutants in the air in a given location. The health risks associated with different values of the AQI are shown in the <strong role="strong">Table</strong>  1.3 <a href="#table:AQI-fig" id="table:AQI-text">below</a> . When the AQI is high, you should limit the time you spend outdoors, especially the time you spend exercising. Avoiding exposure to air pollution can help limit its impact on your health. As you can see from <strong role="strong">Table</strong>  1.3 <a href="#table:AQI-fig" id="table:AQI-text">below</a>, people with certain health problems, including asthma, need to be even more careful about limiting their exposure to air pollution.</p><div><p><strong>Table </strong>1.3 </p><table><p></p><thead><tr><td>Air Quality Index(AQI)</td><td>Quality of Air in Terms of Human Health</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0&ndash;50</td><td>Good</td></tr><tr><td>51&ndash;100</td><td>Moderate</td></tr><tr><td>101&ndash;150</td><td>Unhealthy for sensitive groups<sup>1</sup></td></tr><tr><td>151&ndash;200</td><td>Unhealthy for everyone</td></tr><tr><td>201&ndash;300</td><td>Very unhealthy</td></tr><tr><td>301&ndash;500</td><td>Hazardous</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><sup>1</sup> Sensitive groups include people with asthma, heart disease, or other diseases worsened by air pollution.</p><p>(<em>Source:</em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Quality_Index,">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Quality_Index,</a> <em>License:</em> Creative Commons)</p><p>AQI reports to the public generally refer to levels of ground-level ozone and particulates. Ozone is a gas that forms close to the ground when high concentrations of air pollutants are heated by sunlight. Ozone damages both respiratory and cardiovascular systems. For example, it can cause asthma and decrease lung function. It can also convert cholesterol in arteries to plaque, causing cardiovascular disease. In addition, ozone may increase inflammation, which is a symptom of many diseases.</p><p>Particulates are tiny particles of solids or liquids suspended in the air. The most concentrated particulate pollution tends to be in the air over densely populated metropolitan areas in developing countries. The primary cause is the burning of fossil fuels by motor vehicles and factories. Particulates settle in airways and lungs and damage the respiratory tract. They can cause asthma and lung cancer. Extremely small particulates may pass through the lungs to the bloodstream and contribute to plaque formation in arteries.</p><h4>Indoor Air Pollution</h4><p>Indoor air quality refers to pollutants in the air inside buildings. Indoor air may be more polluted than outdoor air, although with different pollutants. Typical pollutants in indoor air include allergens, mold, bacteria, carbon monoxide, and radon.</p><p>Mold and bacteria can be allergens and also cause respiratory system infections. For example, a type of pneumonia, known as Legionnaire&rsquo;s disease, is caused by bacteria that can spread through air conditioning systems. The disease is not common, but it kills many of the people who contract it.</p><p>Carbon monoxide is a gas produced by cars, furnaces, and other devices that burn fuel. It replaces oxygen in the blood and quickly leads to death. Initial symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning include headache, listlessness, and other flu-like symptoms. Loss of consciousness and death can occur within hours. An estimated 40,000 Americans annually seek medical attention for carbon monoxide poisoning. It is also the most common type of fatal poisoning in the U.S. Carbon monoxide is colorless and odorless, but it can be detected with carbon monoxide detectors like the one in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.15 <a href="#Bio394-02-fig" id="Bio394-02-text">below</a>.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=3178" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio394-02-text" id="Bio394-02-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.15 <caption>Home carbon monoxide detector</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>Sick building syndrome (SBS) is a combination of symptoms associated with working in a particular building, typically an office building. It is most common in new and remodeled buildings. It is usually caused by inadequate ventilation. Chemicals released by new building materials may also contribute to the poor air quality. Generally, conditions improve by increasing ventilation. Symptoms of SBS vary widely. They may include headaches, eye irritation, dry cough, dizziness, and asthma.</p><h3>Bioterrorism</h3><p>Bioterrorism is terrorism by intentional release or spread of pathogens. As shown in <strong role="strong">Tables</strong>  1.4 <a href="#table:category A bioterrorism_agents-fig" id="table:category A bioterrorism_agents-text">Category A Agents</a>,  1.5 <a href="#table:category B bioterrorism_agents-fig" id="table:category B bioterrorism_agents-text">Category B Agents</a>, and  1.6 <a href="#table:category C bioterrorism_agents-fig" id="table:category C bioterrorism_agents-text">Category C Agents</a>, pathogens used in bioterrorism may include bacteria, viruses, or toxins. Toxins are poisons produced by organisms such as bacteria. The agents may be naturally occurring pathogens or pathogens that have been modified by humans to make them more effective agents of bioterrorism. The agents can spread in a variety of ways, including through air, food, water, direct contact, or cuts in the skin. They have the potential to cause epidemics of deadly human diseases.</p><div><p><strong>Table </strong>1.4 </p><table><p>Category A Agents</p><thead><tr><td>Agent</td><td>Type of Pathogen</td><td>Mode of Transmission</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Anthrax</td><td>Bacteria</td><td>Air, food, cuts in skin</td></tr><tr><td>Smallpox</td><td>Virus</td><td>Air, direct contact</td></tr><tr><td>Botulinum</td><td>Toxin</td><td>Food, cuts in skin</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div><p><strong>Table </strong>1.5 </p><table><p>Category B Agents</p><thead><tr><td>Agent</td><td>Type of Pathogen</td><td>Mode of Transmission</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Brucellosis</td><td>Bacteria</td><td>Milk, direct contact</td></tr><tr><td>Ricin</td><td>Toxin</td><td>Air, food, water</td></tr><tr><td>Cholera</td><td>Bacteria</td><td>Food, water</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div><p><strong>Table </strong>1.6 </p><table><p>Category C Agents</p><thead><tr><td>Agent</td><td>Type of Pathogen</td><td>Mode of Transmission</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Hantavirus</td><td>Virus</td><td>Air</td></tr><tr><td>Tuberculosis</td><td>Bacteria</td><td>Air</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h4>Agents of Bioterrorism</h4><p>Bioterrorism agents are classified on the basis of their threat to public health, as shown in the tables above. Category A agents (<strong role="strong">Table</strong>  1.4 <a href="#table:category A bioterrorism_agents-fig" id="table:category A bioterrorism_agents-text">above</a>) include anthrax and smallpox. Agents in this category pose the greatest threat. They spread easily and cause serious illness or death. Category B agents (<strong role="strong">Table</strong>  1.5 <a href="#table:category B bioterrorism_agents-fig" id="table:category B bioterrorism_agents-text">above</a>) are considered less of a threat. They do not spread as easily and are less likely to cause death. Category C agents (<strong role="strong">Table</strong>  1.6 <a href="#table:category C bioterrorism_agents-fig" id="table:category C bioterrorism_agents-text">above</a>) are pathogens that are likely to be engineered for bioterrorism in the future. They are easy to produce and have the potential to cause serious illness or death.</p><h4>Recent Bioterrorism Incidents</h4><p>Two recent bioterrorism incidents in the U.S. received a great deal of media attention. They heightened public awareness of the threat of bioterrorism. In 2001, letters containing anthrax spores were mailed to several news media offices and two U.S. Senate offices. A total of 22 people were infected, and 5 of them died of anthrax. In 2003, deadly ricin toxin was detected in a letter intended for the White House. The letter was intercepted at a mail-handling facility off White House grounds. Fortunately, the ricin did not cause illness or death.</p><h3>Lesson Summary</h3><ul><li>Carcinogens cause cancer by inducing mutations in genes that normally control cell division or other aspects of the cell cycle. </li><li>Both indoor and outdoor air may contain pollutants that can cause human illness and death. </li><li>In bioterrorism, pathogens are intentionally released or spread and have the potential to cause disease epidemics. </li></ul><h3>Review Questions</h3><ol start><li>What is a carcinogen?</li><li>How do carcinogens cause cancer?</li><li>Identify three ways cancer can be treated.</li><li>List four warning signs of cancer.</li><li>How can you use the Air Quality Index to protect your health from air pollution?</li><li>The bacterium that causes plague is classified as a Category A bioterrorism agent.
