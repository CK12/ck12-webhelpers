<h2>Lesson 2.3: Chemical Reactions</h2><h3>Lesson Objectives</h3><ul><li>Describe what happens in a chemical reaction, and identify types of chemical reactions. </li><li>Explain the role of energy in chemical reactions, and define activation energy. </li><li>State factors that affect the rate of chemical reactions. </li><li>Explain the importance of enzymes in organisms, and describe how enzymes work. </li></ul><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A chemical compound may be very different from the substances that combine to form it. For example, the element chlorine (Cl) is a poisonous gas, but when it combines with sodium (Na) to form sodium chloride (NaCl), it is no longer toxic. You may even eat it on your food. Sodium chloride is just table salt. What process changes a toxic chemical like chlorine into a much different substance like table salt?</p><h3>What are Chemical Reactions?</h3><p>A <strong role="strong">chemical reaction</strong> is a process that changes some chemical substances into other chemical substances. The substances that start a chemical reaction are called <strong role="strong">reactants</strong>. The substances that form as a result of a chemical reaction are called <strong role="strong">products</strong>. During the reaction, the reactants are used up to create the products. For example, when methane burns in oxygen, it releases carbon dioxide and water. In this reaction, the reactants are methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), and the products are carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and water (H<sub>2</sub>O).</p><h4>Chemical Equations</h4><p>A chemical reaction can be represented by a chemical equation. Using the same example, the burning of methane gas can be represented by the equation:</p><p>CH<sub>4</sub> + 2 O<sub>2</sub> &rarr; CO<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O.</p><p>The arrow in a chemical equation separates the reactants from the products and shows the direction in which the reaction occurs. If the reaction could also occur in the opposite direction, then two arrows, one pointing in each direction, would be used. On each side of the arrow, a mixture of chemicals is indicated by the chemical symbols joined by a plus sign (+). The numbers preceding some of the chemical symbols (such as 2 O<sub>2</sub>) indicate how many molecules of the chemicals are involved in the reaction. (If there is no number in front of a chemical symbol, it means that just one molecule is involved.)</p><p>In a chemical reaction, the quantity of each element does not change. There is the same amount of each element at the end of the reaction as there was at the beginning. This is reflected in the chemical equation for the reaction. The equation should be balanced. In a balanced equation, the same number of atoms of a given element appear on each side of the arrow. For example, in the equation above, there are four hydrogen atoms on each side of the arrow.</p><h4>Types of Chemical Reactions</h4><p>In general, a chemical reaction involves the breaking and forming of chemical bonds. In the methane reaction above, bonds are broken in methane and oxygen, and bonds are formed in carbon dioxide and water. A reaction like this, in which a compound or element burns in oxygen, is called a <strong role="strong">combustion reaction</strong>. This is just one of many possible types of chemical reactions. Other types of chemical reactions include synthesis, decomposition, and substitution reactions.</p><ul><li>A <strong role="strong">synthesis reaction</strong> occurs when two or more chemical elements or compounds unite to form a more complex product. For example, nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) and hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) unite to form ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>):</li></ul><p>N<sub>2</sub> + 3 H<sub>2</sub> &rarr; 2 NH<sub>3</sub>.</p><ul><li>A <strong role="strong">decomposition reaction</strong> occurs when a compound is broken down into smaller compounds or elements. For example, water (H<sub>2</sub>O) breaks down into hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>):</li></ul><p>2 H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr; 2 H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub>.</p><ul><li>A <strong role="strong">substitution reaction</strong> occurs when one element replaces another element in a compound. For example, sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) replaces hydrogen (H) in hydrochloric acid (HCl), producing sodium chloride (NaCl) and hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>):</li></ul><p>2 Na<sup>+</sup> + 2 HCl &rarr; 2 NaCl + H<sub>2</sub>.</p><h3>Chemical Reactions and Energy</h3><p>Some chemical reactions consume energy, whereas other chemical reactions release energy. Each of the energy changes that occur during a reaction are graphed in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.17 <a href="#BioI-02-03-01-fig" id="BioI-02-03-01-text">below</a>. In the reaction on the left, energy is released. In the reaction on the right, energy is consumed.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2501" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#BioI-02-03-01-text" id="BioI-02-03-01-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.17 <caption>The reaction on the left releases energy. The reaction on the right consumes energy.</caption></p></div><p> </p><h4>Exothermic Reactions</h4><p>Chemical reactions that release energy are called <strong role="strong">exothermic reactions</strong>. An example is the combustion of methane described at the beginning of this lesson. In organisms, exothermic reactions are called <strong role="strong">catabolic reactions</strong>. Catabolic reactions break down molecules into smaller units. An example is the breakdown of glucose molecules for energy. Exothermic reactions can be represented by the general chemical equation:</p><p>Reactants &rarr; Products + Heat.</p><h4>Endothermic Reactions</h4><p>Chemical reactions that consume energy are called <strong role="strong">endothermic reactions</strong>. An example is the synthesis of ammonia, described above. In organisms, endothermic reactions are called <strong role="strong">anabolic reactions</strong>. Anabolic reactions construct molecules from smaller units. An example is the synthesis of proteins from amino acids. Endothermic reactions can be represented by the general chemical equation:</p><p>Reactants + Heat &rarr; Products.</p><h4>Activation Energy</h4><p>Regardless of whether reactions are exothermic or endothermic, they all need energy to get started. This energy is called <strong role="strong">activation energy</strong>. Activation energy is like the push you need to start moving down a slide. The push gives you enough energy to start moving. Once you start, you keep moving without being pushed again. The concept of activation energy is illustrated in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.18 <a href="#Bio2-3-n4-fig" id="Bio2-3-n4-text">below</a>.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2519" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio2-3-n4-text" id="Bio2-3-n4-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.18 <caption>To start this reaction, a certain amount of energy is required, called the activation energy. How much activation energy is required depends on the nature of the reaction and the conditions under which the reaction takes place.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>Why do reactions need energy to get started? In order for reactions to occur, three things must happen, and they all require energy:</p><ul><li>Reactant molecules must collide. To collide, they must move, so they need kinetic energy. </li></ul><ul><li>Unless reactant molecules are positioned correctly, intermolecular forces may push them apart. To overcome these forces and move together requires more energy. </li></ul><ul><li>If reactant molecules collide and move together, there must be enough energy left for them to react. </li></ul><h3>Rates of Chemical Reactions</h3><p>The rates at which chemical reactions take place in organisms are very important. Chemical reactions in organisms are involved in processes ranging from the contraction of muscles to the digestion of food. For example, when you wave goodbye, it requires repeated contractions of muscles in your arm over a period of a couple of seconds. A huge number of reactions must take place in that time, so each reaction cannot take longer than a few milliseconds. If the reactions took much longer, you might not finish waving until sometime next year.</p><p>Factors that help reactant molecules collide and react speed up chemical reactions. These factors include the concentration of reactants and the temperature at which the reactions occur.</p><ul><li>Reactions are usually faster at higher concentrations of reactants. The more reactant molecules there are in a given space, the more likely they are to collide and react. </li></ul><ul><li>Reactions are usually faster at higher temperatures. Reactant molecules at higher temperatures have more energy to move, collide, and react. </li></ul><h3>Enzymes and Biochemical Reactions</h3><p>Most chemical reactions within organisms would be impossible under the conditions in cells. For example, the body temperature of most organisms is too low for reactions to occur quickly enough to carry out life processes. Reactants may also be present in such low concentrations that it is unlikely they will meet and collide. Therefore, the rate of most biochemical reactions must be increased by a catalyst. A catalyst is a chemical that speeds up chemical reactions. In organisms, catalysts are called <strong role="strong">enzymes</strong>.</p><p>Like other catalysts, enzymes are not reactants in the reactions they control. They help the reactants interact but are not used up in the reactions. Instead, they may be used over and over again. Unlike other catalysts, enzymes are usually highly specific for particular chemical reactions. They generally catalyze only one or a few types of reactions.</p><p>Enzymes are extremely efficient in speeding up reactions. They can catalyze up to several million reactions per second. As a result, the difference in rates of biochemical reactions with and without enzymes may be enormous. A typical biochemical reaction might take hours or even days to occur under normal cellular conditions without an enzyme but less than a second with the enzyme. For an animation of a reaction in the presence or absence of an enzyme, see <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/people/giannini/flashanimat/enzymes/prox-orien.swf.">http://www.stolaf.edu/people/giannini/flashanimat/enzymes/prox-orien.swf.</a></p><h4>How Enzymes Work</h4><p>How do enzymes speed up biochemical reactions so dramatically? Like all catalysts, enzymes work by lowering the activation energy of chemical reactions. This is illustrated in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.19 <a href="#Bio2-3-n5-fig" id="Bio2-3-n5-text">below</a>. The biochemical reaction shown in the figure requires about three times as much activation energy without the enzyme as it does with the enzyme. An animation of this process can be viewed at <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/people/giannini/flashanimat/enzymes/transition%20state.swf.">http://www.stolaf.edu/people/giannini/flashanimat/enzymes/transition%20state.swf.</a></p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2518" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio2-3-n5-text" id="Bio2-3-n5-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.19 <caption>The reaction represented by this graph is a combustion reaction involving the reactants glucose (CHO) and oxygen (O). The products of the reaction are carbon dioxide (CO) and water (HO). Energy is also released during the reaction. The enzyme speeds up the reaction by lowering the activation energy needed for the reaction to start. Compare the activation energy with and without the enzyme.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>Enzymes generally lower activation energy by reducing the energy needed for reactants to come together and react. For example:</p><ul><li>Enzymes bring reactants together so they don&rsquo;t have to expend energy moving about until they collide at random. Enzymes bind both reactant molecules (called substrate), tightly and specifically, at a site on the enzyme molecule called the active site (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.20 <a href="#Bio2-3-4-fig" id="Bio2-3-4-text">below</a>).</li></ul><ul><li>By binding reactants at the active site, enzymes also position reactants correctly, so they do not have to overcome intermolecular forces that would otherwise push them apart. This allows the molecules to interact with less energy. </li></ul><ul><li>Enzymes may also allow reactions to occur by different pathways that have lower activation energy. </li></ul><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2502" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio2-3-4-text" id="Bio2-3-4-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.20 <caption>This enzyme molecule binds reactant moleculescalled substrateat its active site, forming an enzyme-substrate complex. This brings the reactants together and positions them correctly so the reaction can occur. After the reaction, the products are released from the enzymes active site. This frees up the enzyme so it can catalyze additional reactions.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>The activities of enzymes also depend on the temperature, ionic conditions, and the pH of the surroundings.</p><p>Some enzymes work best at acidic pHs, while others work best in neutral environments.</p><ul><li>Digestive enzymes secreted in the acidic environment (low pH) of the stomach help break down proteins into smaller molecules. The main digestive enzyme in the stomach is pepsin, which works best at a pH of about 1.5 (see the <em>Digestive and Excretory Systems</em> chapter). These enzymes would not work optimally at other pHs. Trypsin is another enzyme in the digestive system which break protein chains in the food into smaller parts.  Trypsin works in the small intestine, which is not an acidic environment. Trypsin's optimum pH is about 8.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>Biochemical reactions are optimal at physiological temperatures.  For example, most biochemical reactions work best at the normal body temperature of 98.6&#730;F. Many enzymes lose function at lower and higher temperatures.  At higher temperatures, an enzyme&rsquo;s shape deteriorates and only when the temperature comes back to normal does the enzyme regain its shape and normal activity. </li></ul><h4>Importance of Enzymes</h4><p>Enzymes are involved in most of the chemical reactions that take place in organisms. About 4,000 such reactions are known to be catalyzed by enzymes, but the number may be even higher. Needed for reactions that regulate cells, enzymes allow movement, transport materials around the body, and move substances in and out of cells.</p><p>In animals, another important function of enzymes is to help digest food. Digestive enzymes speed up reactions that break down large molecules of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats into smaller molecules the body can use (<em>See</em> Chapter: Digestive and Excretory Systems). Without digestive enzymes, animals would not be able to break down food molecules quickly enough to provide the energy and nutrients they need to survive.</p><h3>Lesson Summary</h3><ul><li>A chemical reaction is a process that changes some chemical substances into others.
