Most of the structures are inside the body. The female reproductive system has several functions:</p><ul><li>producing eggs, which are female gametes </li><li>secreting female sex hormones </li><li>receiving sperm during sexual intercourse </li><li>supporting the development of a fetus </li><li>delivering a baby during birth </li><li>breastfeeding a baby after birth </li></ul><p>During puberty, a girl develops into a sexually mature woman, capable of producing eggs and reproducing.</p><h3>Sexual Development in Females</h3><p>As you read in Lesson 25.1, the main differences between boys and girls at birth are their reproductive organs. Unlike males, females are not influenced by the male sex hormone testosterone during embryonic and fetal development. This is because they lack a Y-chromosome. As a result, females do not develop male reproductive organs.</p><h4>Development Before Birth</h4><p>Unless an embryo is stimulated by testosterone, the reproductive organs develop into female organs, such as the ovaries and uterus. By the third month of fetal development, most of the internal female organs have formed. Immature <strong role="strong">ova</strong>, or eggs, also form in the ovary before birth. Whereas a male produces sperm throughout his lifetime (after puberty), a female produces all the eggs she will ever make before birth.</p><p>Like baby boys, baby girls are born with all their reproductive organs present but immature and unable to function. Female reproductive organs grow very little during childhood. They begin to grow rapidly and to mature during puberty.</p><h4>Changes of Puberty</h4><p>From Lesson 25.1, you know that puberty is the period during which humans become sexually mature. Puberty in girls differs from puberty in boys in several ways, including when it begins, how long it lasts, and the hormones involved. Girls begin puberty a year or two earlier than boys, and they complete puberty in about four years instead of six. In females, the major sex hormone is <strong role="strong">estrogen</strong> rather than testosterone.</p><p>Puberty in girls starts when the hypothalamus in the brain stimulates the pituitary gland to secrete hormones that target the ovaries. The pituitary hormones are luteinizing hormone, or LH, and follicle-stimulating hormone, or FSH. These hormones stimulate the ovary to produce estrogen.</p><p>Estrogen has many functions that you will read more about below. During puberty, estrogen promotes growth and other physical changes in females. For example, estrogen stimulates growth of the breasts and uterus. It also stimulates development of bones and contributes to the adolescent growth spurt in height. These and several other changes in females during puberty are listed in <strong role="strong">Table</strong>  1.3 <a href="#table:female_puberty_changes-fig" id="table:female_puberty_changes-text">below</a>:</p><div><p><strong>Table </strong>1.3 </p><table><p></p><thead><tr><td><strong role="strong">Changes in Reproductive Organs</strong></td><td> </td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Ovaries and follicles grow</td><td>Uterus grows and endometrium thickens</td></tr><tr><td>Other reproductive structures grow</td><td>Menstrual cycle begins</td></tr><tr><td><strong role="strong">Other Physical Changes</strong></td><td> </td></tr><tr><td>Breasts develop</td><td>Long bones grow and mature</td></tr><tr><td>Pubic hair grows</td><td>Underarm hair grows</td></tr><tr><td>Body fat increases</td><td>Apocrine sweat glands develop</td></tr><tr><td>Pelvis widens</td><td> </td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Some of the changes involve the maturation of organs, such as ovaries, that are necessary for reproduction. Mature reproductive organs are primary sex characteristics. Other changes, such as growth of pubic hair, lead to traits that are secondary sex characteristics. One of the most significant changes in females during puberty is menarche. <strong role="strong">Menarche</strong> is the beginning of menstruation, or monthly periods, which will be discussed later.</p><h4>Adolescent Growth Spurt</h4><p>Females go through an adolescent growth spurt in height as boys do. However, the growth spurt in girls starts a year or two earlier and ends about three years sooner. Girls also do not grow as rapidly during their peak growth rate. Although females start the growth spurt only 2 centimeters shorter than males, on average, by the time they stop growing females are an average of 10 centimeters shorter.</p><h4>Timing of Puberty</h4><p>The changes of puberty usually happen in the same order for most females. The first observable change is typically the beginning of breast development. This happens by age 10 years in the majority of girls in the U.S. The appearance of pubic hair usually occurs next, at age 10.5 years, on average. The growth spurt in height also usually begins during the first year of puberty. During the first two years of puberty, the ovaries and uterus gradually increase in size. Menarche occurs relatively late in puberty, typically between the ages of 12 and 13 years in U.S. girls. After menarche, a female generally keeps growing for another year or two and attains her adult height by an average age of 14.5 years.</p><p>As in males, there is a wide range of ages at which particular changes of female puberty normally occur. For example, menarche may occur as early as age 8 years or as late as age 16. Differences in age at menarche and other changes of puberty are due to both genetic factors and environmental factors, such as diet. A female who goes through puberty earlier or later than her peers may worry that she is not developing normally. Although such variation is usually normal, she should talk with her health care provider if she has concerns.</p><h3>Female Reproductive Organs</h3><p>The female reproductive system is shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.4 <a href="#Bio40-02-01-fig" id="Bio40-02-01-text">below</a>. Only a few of the structures are external to the body. All the main reproductive organs are internal.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=3189" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio40-02-01-text" id="Bio40-02-01-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.4 <caption>The female reproductive system.</caption></p></div><p> </p><h4>External Organs</h4><p>The external female reproductive structures are referred to collectively as the <strong role="strong">vulva</strong>. They include the labia and mons pubis. The labia are the &ldquo;lips&rdquo; of the vulva. They protect the vagina and urethra, both of which have openings in the vulva. The mons pubis consists of fatty tissue covering the pubic bone. It protects the pubic bone and vulva from injury.</p><h4>Internal Organs</h4><p>The internal female reproductive organs include the vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. These organs are shown from the front, without any other structures blocking them, in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.5 <a href="#Bio402-02-fig" id="Bio402-02-text">below</a>. This makes it easier to see the shape and size of the organs and where they are located relative to one another.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=3200" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio402-02-text" id="Bio402-02-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.5 <caption>Internal female reproductive organs.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>The <strong role="strong">vagina</strong> is a tube-like structure about 8 to 10 centimeters long. It begins at the vulva and extends to the uterus. It has muscular walls lined with mucous membranes. The vagina has two major reproductive functions. It receives sperm during sexual intercourse, and it provides a passageway for a baby to leave the mother&rsquo;s body during birth.</p><p>The <strong role="strong">uterus</strong> is a muscular organ about 7.5 centimeters long and 5 centimeters wide. It has a thick lining of tissues known as the endometrium. The lower, narrower end of the uterus is called the <strong role="strong">cervix</strong>. The uterus is where a fetus grows and develops until birth. During pregnancy, the uterus can expand dramatically to accommodate the growing baby. Muscular contractions of the uterus push the baby through the cervix during childbirth.</p><p>Extending from the upper corners of the uterus are the two <strong role="strong">Fallopian tubes</strong>. The tubes are about 7 to 14 centimeters long. Each tube reaches (but is not attached to) one of the ovaries. The ovary end of the tube has a fringelike structure (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.6 <a href="#Bio40-02-05-fig" id="Bio40-02-05-text">below</a>) that moves with a wavelike motion.</p><p>The two <strong role="strong">ovaries</strong> are small, oval-shaped organs that lie on either side of the uterus. They are the egg-producing organs of the female reproductive system, and they contain hundreds of thousands of immature eggs. Each egg is located within a structure called a <strong role="strong">follicle</strong>. A follicle consists of the egg surrounded by special cells that protect the egg until puberty and then help the egg mature.</p><h4>The Breasts</h4><p>The breasts are considered secondary sex characteristics, rather than organs of reproduction. They are described here because of their role in nurturing an infant after birth. As shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.7 <a href="#Bio40-2-3-fig" id="Bio40-2-3-text">below</a>, each breast contains mammary glands. The cells of mammary glands secrete milk, which drains into ducts leading to the nipple. A suckling baby squeezes the milk out of the ducts and through the nipple.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=3198" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio40-2-3-text" id="Bio40-2-3-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.7 <caption>Cross-section of a human breast.</caption></p></div><p> </p><h3>Egg Production</h3><p>At birth, a female&rsquo;s ovaries contain all the eggs she will ever produce. However, the eggs do not start to mature until she enters puberty. After menarche, one egg typically matures each month throughout a female&rsquo;s adult years until she reaches middle adulthood.</p><h4>Oogenesis</h4><p><strong role="strong">Oogenesis</strong> is the process of producing eggs in the ovary. Eggs are haploid cells, having half the number of chromosomes of other cells in the body, which are diploid cells. Like sperm, eggs must be haploid in order for sexual reproduction to result in diploid offspring. Like spermatogenesis, oogenesis occurs in several steps that involve different types of cells. The steps of oogenesis are listed in <strong role="strong">Table</strong>  1.4 <a href="#table:oogenesis-fig" id="table:oogenesis-text">below</a>.</p><p>Oogenesis begins when an oogonium with the diploid number of chromosomes undergoes mitosis to form primary oocytes, also with the diploid number. It proceeds as a primary oocyte undergoes the first cell division of meiosis to form secondary oocytes with the haploid number of chromosomes. A secondary oocyte undergoes the second meiotic cell division to form a haploid ovum if it is fertilized by a sperm.</p><div><p><strong>Table </strong>1.4 </p><table><p></p><thead><tr><td>Type of Cell</td><td>Number of Chromosomes</td><td>Process</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Oogonium</td><td>Diploid</td><td>Mitosis</td></tr><tr><td>Primary oocyte</td><td>Diploid</td><td>Meiosis 1</td></tr><tr><td>Secondary oocyte</td><td>Haploid</td><td>Meiosis 2</td></tr><tr><td>Ovum (mature egg)</td><td>Haploid</td><td>Fertilization</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Oogenesis begins with <strong role="strong">oogonia</strong> (singular, oogonium), which are the immature eggs that form in the ovaries before birth. Oogonia are diploid cells and equivalent to spermatogonia in males. By about the fifth month of fetal development, the ovaries contain about seven million oogonia.</p><p>Over the next few months, oogonia undergo mitosis, forming cells called primary oocytes. Primary oocytes are also diploid cells. Before birth, primary oocytes begin the first division of meiosis, but they do not complete it until long after birth. At birth, the average female has about two million primary oocytes in her ovaries. Throughout childhood, the number of oocytes falls as they deteriorate and disappear. By puberty, there are only about 300,000 to 400,000 primary oocytes left in the average girl&rsquo;s ovaries.</p><h4>Maturation of a Follicle</h4><p>Beginning in puberty, each month one of the follicles starts to mature (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.8 <a href="#Bio40-02-04-fig" id="Bio40-02-04-text">below</a>). The primary oocyte in the follicle resumes meiosis and divides to form a secondary oocyte and a smaller cell, called a polar body. Both the secondary oocyte and polar body are haploid cells. The secondary oocyte has most of the cytoplasm from the original cell and is much larger than the polar body. The polar body disintegrates and disappears from the ovary.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=3190" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio40-02-04-text" id="Bio40-02-04-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.8 <caption>This diagram shows the monthly cycle the ovary goes through in a post-pubertal female. First, an oocyte and its surrounding follicle starts to mature. When the secondary oocyte is mature, it bursts from the follicle and ovary. Then the ruptured follicle develops into a corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. If the egg is not fertilized by a sperm, the corpus luteum degenerates and virtually disappears from the ovary.</caption></p></div><p> </p><h4>Ovulation</h4><p>Ovulation is the release of a secondary oocyte by the ovary. Ovulation occurs every 28 days, on average, in a sexually mature female, but may range normally from 24 to 36 days. As shown in <strong role="strong">Figure </strong>  1.8 <a href="#Bio40-02-04-fig" id="Bio40-02-04-text">above</a>, during ovulation a secondary oocyte bursts out of its follicle and through the ovary wall to enter the abdominal cavity.</p><p>Each month only one of the ovaries matures a follicle and releases an egg. Which ovary matures a follicle in a given month? Scientists say that it appears to be random.</p><p>After the secondary oocyte leaves the ovary, it is swept into the Fallopian tube by the waving, fringelike end. This is illustrated in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.6 <a href="#Bio40-02-05-fig" id="Bio40-02-05-text">below</a>. Tiny hairlike projections, called cilia, line the tube and help move the oocyte through to the uterus. If the secondary oocyte is fertilized by a sperm as it is passing through the Fallopian tube, it divides to form a mature egg and a polar body, finishing meiosis. (As before, the polar body contains very little cytoplasm and disintegrates.) If the secondary oocyte is not fertilized, it passes into the uterus as an immature egg.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=3191" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio40-02-05-text" id="Bio40-02-05-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.6 <caption>This diagram also shows the events of the menstrual cycle that occur in the ovary. After a secondary oocyte bursts from the ovary, it usually is swept into a Fallopian tube. The waving, fringelike ends of the tube help capture the egg.</caption></p></div><p> </p><h3>Menstrual Cycle and Menstruation</h3><p>Ovulation is part of the <strong role="strong">menstrual cycle</strong>, which occurs each month in a sexually mature female. Another part of the cycle is menstruation. <strong role="strong">Menstruation</strong> is the process in which blood and other tissues are shed from the uterus and leave the body through the vagina. It is also called a menstrual period, or menses. The menstrual cycle is sometimes divided into two cycles, called the ovarian cycle and the uterine cycle. The ovarian cycle includes the events that occur in the ovary. The uterine cycle refer to the events that occur in the uterus. The two cycles are closely related, so here they are described together and referred to jointly as the menstrual cycle.</p><h4>Phases of the Menstrual Cycle</h4><p>The phases of the menstrual cycle are summarized in <strong role="strong">Table</strong>  1.5 <a href="#table:menstrual cycle phases-fig" id="table:menstrual cycle phases-text">below</a>. The cycle begins with the menstrual phase, which typically lasts from one to four days. This is when menstruation occurs. During the menstrual phase, arteries that supply the endometrium of the uterus constrict and break. Gradually, blood and endometrial tissues detach from the inside of the uterus and pass from the uterus to the vagina and then out of the body. If there is an immature egg in the uterus, it passes out of the body with the menstrual flow.</p><p>The menstrual cycle (as shown in <strong role="strong">Table</strong>  1.5 <a href="#table:menstrual cycle phases-fig" id="table:menstrual cycle phases-text">below</a>) includes an ovarian and a uterine cycle. Events in the ovarian cycle include maturation of a follicle, release of an egg, and formation of the corpus luteum. Events in the uterine cycle include menstruation, development of the endometrium, and thickening of the endometrium in preparation for an egg.</p><div><p><strong>Table </strong>1.5 </p><table><p></p><thead><tr><td>Name of Phase</td><td>Days</td><td>Events</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Menstrual Phase</td><td>1&ndash;4</td><td>Menstruation occurs</td></tr><tr><td>Follicular Phase</td><td>5&ndash;13</td><td>Follicle matures Endometrium develops</td></tr><tr><td>Ovulation</td><td>14</td><td>Ovary releases egg</td></tr><tr><td>Luteal Phase</td><td>15&ndash;28</td><td>Follicle becomes corpus luteum Endometrium prepares for egg</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The next phase of the cycle is called the <strong role="strong">follicular phase</strong>. After menstruation, the endometrium in the uterus begins to build up again. At the same time, several follicles start maturing in the ovary. Only one of these maturing follicles will complete maturation. The rest will eventually deteriorate and disappear. By the middle of the menstrual cycle, around day 14, the remaining mature follicle releases its oocyte from the ovary in the process of ovulation.</p><p>Following ovulation, the <strong role="strong">luteal phase</strong> begins. During the luteal phase, the endometrium of the uterus continues to prepare for a fertilized egg. For example, it becomes thicker and develops more blood vessels. At the same time, the mature follicle that just released its egg develops into a structure called a corpus luteum (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.6 <a href="#Bio40-02-05-fig" id="Bio40-02-05-text">above</a>).</p><p>If the egg is fertilized and implants, or embeds itself, in the endometrium of the uterus, the endometrium will be maintained and help nourish it. If the egg is not fertilized, the endometrium will break down, leading to menstruation. This begins a new cycle.</p><p>The events of the menstrual cycle always occur in the same sequence, but their timing may vary considerably. There is a great deal of normal variation in the length of the overall cycle and of the individual phases. Variation may occur from one female to another and also from one cycle to the next for a given female.</p><p>Some females have symptoms&mdash;such as bloating, abdominal cramps, and mood swings&mdash;for several days before or during menstruation each month. If the symptoms are severe enough to interfere with daily life, the condition is called premenstrual syndrome, or PMS. Symptoms of PMS often can be helped with medications or lifestyle changes.</p><h4>Role of Hormones</h4><p>The same hormones that control female puberty and oogenesis also control the menstrual cycle: estrogen, LH, and FSH. Estrogen controls the secretion of the two pituitary hormones by acting on the hypothalamus, which controls the pituitary gland. This is shown in <strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.9 <a href="#Bio402-06-fig" id="Bio402-06-text">below</a>. When the estrogen level rises in the blood, it stimulates the pituitary (via the hypothalamus) to secrete more or less LH and FSH.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=3192" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio402-06-text" id="Bio402-06-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.9 <caption>This diagram shows how hormones control the menstrual cycle with negative and positive feedback.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>In negative feedback, rising levels of hormones feedback to the hypothalamus and pituitary gland to decrease production of the hormones. In positive feedback, rising levels of hormones feedback to increase hormone production. During most of the menstrual cycle, estrogen and progesterone provide negative feedback to the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. This keeps their levels more or less constant. During days 12&ndash;14, however, estrogen provides positive feedback to the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. This causes a rapid rise in the production of estrogen by the ovary and leads to ovulation.</p><p>Another hormone involved in the menstrual cycle is progesterone. The word "progesterone" literally means &ldquo;pro-gestational hormone.&rdquo; <strong role="strong">Progesterone</strong> is a hormone that promotes gestation, or the carrying of a fetus. The function of progesterone in the menstrual cycle is to maintain the endometrium of the uterus.</p><p>Change in the levels of these four hormones (estrogen, LH, FSH, and progesterone) occur during the menstrual cycle (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong>  1.10 <a href="#Bio40-02-07-fig" id="Bio40-02-07-text">below</a>). After menstruation occurs, estrogen secreted by the ovaries increases. This causes the endometrium of the uterus to thicken. FSH from the pituitary stimulates follicles in the ovary to mature. The maturing follicles produce estrogen, and the level of estrogen in the blood rises. When estrogen reaches a high level in the blood, it stimulates the pituitary gland to release a surge of LH. The spike in LH stimulates the one remaining mature follicle to burst open and release its oocyte.</p><p> </p><div style="float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class="figure"><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=3204" width="256px" /></div> <p><a href="#Bio40-02-07-text" id="Bio40-02-07-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p><p><strong>Figure </strong>1.10 <caption>This graph shows how hormone levels change during the menstrual cycle.</caption></p></div><p> </p><p>During the first half of the cycle, negative feedback keeps levels of FSH, LH, estrogen, and progesterone relatively stable. During ovulation, positive feedback causes a burst of FSH, LH, and estrogen. During the second half of the cycle, progesterone rises as the corpus luteum in the ovary matures and produces this hormone. Negative feedback helps keep levels of the other three hormones fairly constant</p><p>After the oocyte is released, LH stimulates the mature follicle to develop into a corpus luteum. The corpus luteum then starts secreting progesterone, which maintains the endometrium of the uterus. What happens next depends on whether the egg has been fertilized.</p><ul><li>If the egg has been fertilized, it will soon start producing a hormone that helps maintain the corpus luteum. As a result, the corpus luteum will continue producing progesterone and maintain the endometrium. </li><li>If the egg has not been fertilized, the corpus luteum will disintegrate and stop producing progesterone. Without progesterone, the endometrium will break down, detach from the uterus, and pass out of the body during menstruation. </li></ul><h4>Menopause</h4><p>For most women in the U.S., the menstrual cycle continues into their forties. Then it gradually becomes more and more irregular until it finally stops altogether, generally by their early fifties. <strong role="strong">Menopause</strong> occurs when a woman has gone through 12 consecutive months without a menstrual period. She can no longer reproduce because her ovaries no longer produce eggs.</p><p>The cause of menopause is a natural decline in estrogen secretion by the ovaries as a woman ages. It may take from several months to a few years for her body to adjust to the drop in estrogen. During this time, she may experience hot flashes, mood swings, and other symptoms.</p><h3>Lesson Summary</h3><ul><li>The female reproductive system forms before birth but does not become capable of reproduction until it matures during puberty. </li><li>The female reproductive system includes organs and other structures that produce and release eggs, secrete female sex hormones, and enable the development and birth of a fetus. </li><li>Immature eggs form in the ovaries before birth.
