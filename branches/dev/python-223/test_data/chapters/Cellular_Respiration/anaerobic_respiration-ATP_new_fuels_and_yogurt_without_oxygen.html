  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>After the photosynthetic &ldquo;oxygen catastrophe&rdquo;
  challenged life between 2.5 and 3 billion years ago, evolution
  rebounded with biochemical pathways to harness and protect
  against oxygen&rsquo;s power. Today, most organisms use
  O<sub>2</sub> in aerobic respiration to produce ATP. Almost all
  animals, most fungi, and some bacteria are <strong role=
  "strong">obligate aerobes</strong>, which require oxygen. Some
  plants and fungi and many bacteria retain the ability to make ATP
  without oxygen. These <strong role="strong">facultative
  anaerobes</strong> use ancient anaerobic pathways when oxygen is
  limited. A few bacteria remain as <strong role="strong">obligate
  anaerobes</strong>, which die in the presence of oxygen and
  depend on only the first (anaerobic) stage of cellular
  respiration.</p>

  <p>Aerobic and anaerobic pathways diverge after glycolysis splits
  glucose into two molecules of pyruvate:</p>

    <p>Pyruvate still contains a great deal of chemical energy. If
    oxygen is present, pyruvate enters the mitochondria for
    complete breakdown by the Krebs Cycle and electron transport
    chain. If oxygen is not present, cells must transform pyruvate
    to regenerate NAD+ in order to continue making ATP. Two
    different pathways accomplish this with rather famous products:
    lactic acid and ethyl alcohol (<strong role=
    "strong">Figure</strong> 1.19 <a href="#Bio5-3-1-fig" id=
    "Bio5-3-1-text" name="Bio5-3-1-text">above</a>). Making ATP in
    the absence of oxygen by glycolysis alone is known as
    fermentation. Therefore, these two pathways are called
    <strong role="strong">lactic acid fermentation</strong> and
    <strong role="strong">alcoholic fermentation</strong>. If you
    lack interest in organisms, such as yeast and bacteria, which
    have &ldquo;stuck with&rdquo; the anaerobic tradition, the
    products of these chemical reactions may still intrigue you.
    Fermentation makes bread, yogurt, beer, wine, and some new
    biofuels. In addition, some of your body&rsquo;s cells are
    facultative anaerobes, retaining one of these ancient pathways
    for short-term, emergency use.</p>

    <h3>Lactic Acid Fermentation: Muscle Cells and Yogurt</h3>

    <p>For chicken or turkey dinners, do you prefer light meat or
    dark? Do you consider yourself a sprinter, or a distance
    runner? (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong> 1.20 <a href=

    <h4>Are Drumsticks and Athletic Prowess Related?</h4>

    <p>Yes! Muscle color reflects its specialization for aerobic or
    anaerobic metabolism. Although humans are obligate aerobes, our
    muscle cells have not given up on ancient pathways which allow
    them to keep producing ATP quickly when oxygen runs low. The
    difference is more pronounced in chickens and grouse
    (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong> 1.21 <a href=
    "#Bio53-03aa-fig" id="Bio53-03aa-text" name=
    "Bio53-03aa-text">below</a>), which stand around all day on
    their legs. For long periods of time, they carry out aerobic
    respiration in their &ldquo;specialized-for-endurance&rdquo;
    red muscles. If you have ever hunted grouse, you know that
    these birds &ldquo;flush&rdquo; with great speed over short
    distances. Such &ldquo;sprinting&rdquo; flight depends on
    anaerobic respiration in the white cells of breast and wing
    muscle. No human muscle is all red or all white, but chances
    are, if you excel at running short distances or at weight
    lifting, you have more white glycolytic fibers in your leg
    muscles. If you run marathons, you probably have more red
    oxidative fibers.</p>

    <p>You probably were not aware that muscle cells
    &ldquo;ferment.&rdquo; <strong role="strong">Lactic acid
    fermentation</strong> is the type of anaerobic respiration
    carried out by yogurt bacteria (<em>Lactobacillus</em> and
    others) and by your own muscle cells when you work them hard
    and fast. Converting pyruvate to 3-carbon lactic acid (see
    <strong role="strong">Figure</strong> below) regenerates NAD+
    so that glycolysis can continue to make ATP in low-oxygen
    conditions.</p>

    <p>For <em>Lactobacillus</em>bacteria, the acid resulting from
    fermentation kills bacterial competitors in buttermilk, yogurt,
    and some cottage cheese. The benefits extend to humans who
    enjoy these foods, as well (<strong role=

    <p>You may have noticed this type of fermentation in your own
    muscles, because muscle fatigue and pain are associated with
    lactic acid. Keep this in mind, however, as we discuss a second
    type of fermentation, which produces alcohol. Imagine what
    would happen as you ran a race if muscle cells conducted
    alcoholic rather than lactic acid fermentation!</p>

    <h3>Alcoholic Fermentation: A &ldquo;New&rdquo; Source of
    Energy?</h3>

    <p>Have you fueled your car with corn? You have, if you bought
    gas within the city of Portland, Oregon. Portland was the first
    city to require that all gasoline sold within the city limits
    contain at least 10% ethanol. By mid-2006, nearly 6 million
    &ldquo;flex-fuel&rdquo; vehicles &ndash; which can use gasoline
    blends up to 85% ethanol (E85 &ndash; <strong role=
    "strong">Figure</strong> 1.23 <a href="#Bio5-3-n2-fig" id=
    "Bio5-3-n2-text" name="Bio5-3-n2-text">below</a>) were
    traveling US roads. This &ldquo;new&rdquo; industry employs an
    &ldquo;old&rdquo; crew of yeast and bacteria to make ethanol by
    an even older biochemical pathway &ndash; <strong role=
    "strong">alcoholic fermentation</strong>. Many people consider
    &ldquo;renewable&rdquo; biofuels such as ethanol a partial
    solution to the declining availability of
    &ldquo;nonrenewable&rdquo; fossil fuels. Although controversy
    still surrounds the true efficiency of producing fuel from
    corn, ethanol is creeping into the world fuel resource picture
    (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong> 1.24 <a href=

    <p>You are probably most familiar with the term "fermentation"
    in terms of alcoholic beverages. You may not have considered
    that the process is actually a chemical reaction certain
    bacteria and yeasts use to make ATP. Like lactic acid
    fermentation, alcoholic fermentation processes pyruvate one
    step further in order to regenerate NAD+ so that glycolysis can
    continue to make ATP. In this form of anaerobic respiration,
    pyruvate is broken down into ethyl alcohol and carbon
    dioxide:</p>

    <p>We have domesticated yeast (<strong role=
    "strong">Figures</strong> 1.25 <a href="#Bio5-3-n3-fig" id=
    "Bio5-3-n3-text" name="Bio5-3-n3-text">below</a> and

    "#Bio5-3-n4-fig" id="Bio5-3-n4-text" name=
    "Bio5-3-n4-text">below</a>) to carry out this type of anaerobic
    respiration for many commercial purposes. When you make bread,
    you employ the yeast to make the bread &ldquo;rise&rdquo; by
    producing bubbles of carbon dioxide gas. Why do you suppose
    that eating bread does not intoxicate you?</p>

    <p>Brewers of beer and wine use yeast to add alcohol to
    beverages. Traditional varieties of yeast not only make but
    also limit the quantity of alcohol in these beverages, because
    above 18% by volume, alcohol becomes toxic to the yeast itself!
    We have recently developed new strains of yeast which can
    tolerate up to 25% alcohol by volume. These are used primarily
    in the production of ethanol fuel.</p>

    <p>Human use of alcoholic fermentation depends on the chemical
    energy remaining in pyruvate after glycolysis. Transforming
    pyruvate does not add ATP to that produced in glycolysis, and
    for anaerobic organisms, this is the end of the ATP-producing
    line. All types of anaerobic respiration yield only 2 ATP per
    glucose. In the next section, we will compare the advantages
    and disadvantages of aerobic and anaerobic respiration.</p>

    <h3>Aerobic vs. Anaerobic Respiration: A Comparison</h3>

    <p>As aerobes in a world of <strong role=
    "strong">aerobic</strong> organisms, we tend to consider
    aerobic respiration &ldquo;better&rdquo; than <strong role=
    "strong">fermentation</strong>. In some ways, it is. However,
    anaerobic respiration has persisted far longer on this planet,
    through major changes in atmosphere and life. There must be
    value in this alternative way of making ATP. In this last
    section, we will compare the advantages and disadvantages of
    these two types of respiration.</p>

    <p>A major argument in favor of aerobic over anaerobic
    respiration is overall energy production. Without oxygen,
    organisms can only break 6-carbon glucose into two 3-carbon
    molecules. As we saw earlier, glycolysis releases only enough
    energy to produce two (net) ATP per molecule of glucose. In
    contrast, aerobic respiration breaks glucose all the way down
    to CO<sub>2</sub>, producing up to 38 ATP. Membrane transport
    costs can reduce this theoretical yield, but aerobic
    respiration consistently produces at least 15 times as much ATP
    as anaerobic respiration. This vast increase in energy
    production probably explains why aerobic organisms have come to
    dominate life on earth. It may also explain how organisms were
    able to increase in size, adding multicellularity and great
    diversity.</p>

    <p>However, anaerobic pathways persist, and a few obligate
    anaerobes have survived over 2 billion years beyond the
    evolution of aerobic respiration. What are the advantages of
    fermentation?</p>

    <p>One advantage is available to organisms occupying the few
    anoxic (lacking oxygen) niches remaining on earth. Oxygen
    remains the highly reactive, toxic gas which caused the
    &ldquo;Oxygen Catastrophe.&rdquo; Aerobic organisms have merely
    learned a few tricks &ndash; enzymes and antioxidants - to
    protect themselves. Organisms living in anoxic niches do not
    run the risk of oxygen exposure, so they do not need to spend
    energy to build these elaborate chemicals.</p>

    <p>Individual cells which experience anoxic conditions face
    greater challenges. We mentioned earlier that muscle cells
    &ldquo;still remember&rdquo; anaerobic respiration, using
    lactic acid fermentation to make ATP in low-oxygen conditions.
    Brain cells do not &ldquo;remember&rdquo;, and consequently
    cannot make any ATP without oxygen. This explains why death
    follows for most humans who endure more than four minutes
    without oxygen.</p>

    <p>Variation in muscle cells gives further insight into some
    benefits of anaerobic respiration. In vertebrate muscles,
    lactic acid fermentation allows muscles to produce ATP quickly
    during short bursts of strenuous activity. Muscle cells
    specialized for this type of activity show differences in
    structure as well as chemistry. Red muscle fibers are
    &ldquo;dark&rdquo; because they have a rich blood supply for a
    steady supply of oxygen, and a protein, myoglobin, which holds
    extra oxygen. They also contain more mitochondria, the
    organelle in which the Krebs cycle and electron transport chain
    conclude aerobic respiration. White muscle cells are
    &ldquo;light&rdquo; because they lack the rich blood supply,
    have fewer mitochondria, and store glycogen rather than oxygen.
    When you eat dark meat, you are eating endurance muscle. When
    you eat white meat, you are eating muscle built for
    sprinting.</p>

    <p>Each type of muscle fiber has advantages and disadvantages,
    which reflect their differing biochemical pathways. Aerobic
    respiration in red muscles produces a great deal of ATP from
    far less glucose - but slowly, over a long time. Anaerobic
    respiration in white muscles produces ATP rapidly for quick
    bursts of speed, but a predator who continues pursuit may
    eventually catch a white-muscled prey.</p>

    <p>In summary, aerobic and anaerobic respiration each have
    advantages under specific conditions. Aerobic respiration
    produces far more ATP, but risks exposure to oxygen toxicity.
    Anaerobic respiration is less energy-efficient, but allows
    survival in habitats which lack oxygen. Within the human body,
    both are important to muscle function. Muscle cells specialized
    for aerobic respiration provide endurance, and those
    specialized for lactic acid fermentation support short but
    intense energy expenditures. Both ways of making ATP play
    critical roles in life on earth.</p>

    <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>In the two to three billion years since photosynthesis
      added oxygen to earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, life has become
      mostly aerobic. Some organisms and types of cells retain the
      older, anaerobic pathways for making ATP; these pathways
      comprise anaerobic respiration or fermentation.</li>

      <li>Obligate aerobes require oxygen to make ATP. Obligate
      anaerobes cannot survive in the presence of oxygen, so they
      occupy only anoxic habitats. Facultative anaerobes make ATP
      with oxygen, but if oxygen levels become low, they can use
      fermentation.</li>

      <li>Some bacteria, including those we employ to make yogurt,
      make ATP using lactic acid fermentation; the acid may help
      reduce competition from other bacteria. Muscle cells can
      continue to produce ATP when O<sub>2</sub> runs low using
      lactic acid fermentation, but muscle fatigue and pain may
      result.</li>

      <li>Red muscle fibers use mostly aerobic respiration to make
      ATP for endurance tasks; white muscle fibers use mostly
      lactic acid fermentation to make ATP quickly for short,
      intense activities. Human muscles contain a mixture of red
      and white fibers, but genetics may give sprinters more white
      fibers, and marathoners more red.</li>

      <li>Both alcoholic and lactic acid fermentation pathways
      change pyruvate in order to continue producing ATP by
      glycolysis.</li>

      <li>Ethanol produced by bacteria through alcoholic
      fermentation of corn (and perhaps other fuels in the near
      future) may provide a more renewable fuel for vehicles than
      the fossil fuels upon which we currently depend. We employ
      yeasts to help make bread through alcoholic fermentation; as
      they produce carbon dioxide, the bread dough rises. We employ
      anaerobic organisms to make beer and wine through alcoholic
      fermentation; the alcohol content is limited to 18% by volume
      because levels above that are toxic to these organisms.</li>

      <li>Aerobic respiration is far more energy-efficient than
      anaerobic respiration. Aerobic processes produce up to 38 ATP
      per glucose. Anaerobic processes yield only 2 ATP per
      glucose.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Points to Consider</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Humans seem to harness anaerobic respiration much more
      than aerobic respiration to create useful products, such as
      foods or fuels. Use your understanding of the two processes
      to explain why this makes sense.</li>

      <li>Some controversy exists over whether or not ethanol
      produced by fermentation of corn is an efficient and wise way
      to produce fuel. Can you think of some reasons, pro and/or
      con?</li>

      <li>How might the wing muscles of birds which migrate long
      distances compare to those of birds which do not migrate? Why
      do you suppose human muscles are mixtures of red and white
      fibers, rather than specialized, as in many birds?</li>

    <table>
      <caption>
        Anaerobic and aerobic respiration share the glycolysis
        pathway. If oxygen is not present, fermentation may take
        place, producing lactic acid or ethyl alcohol and carbon
        dioxide. Products of fermentation still contain chemical
        energy, and are used widely to make foods and fuels.

      <caption>
        Light meat or dark? Sprinting or endurance? Muscle cells
        know two ways of making ATP aerobic and anaerobic
        respiration.
      </caption>

      <caption>
        Ruffed grouse use anaerobic respiration (lactic acid
        fermentation) in wing and breast muscles for quick bursts
        of speed to escape from predators (and hunters!).
      </caption>

      <caption>
        bacteria use the same type of anaerobic respiration as our
        muscle cells. Lactic acid reduces competition from other
        bacteria, and flavors yogurt, as well!
      </caption>

      <caption>
        Ethanol provides up to 85% of the energy needs of new
        fuel-flex cars. Although its energy efficiency is still
        controversial, ethanol from corn or cellulose appears to be
        more renewable than fossil fuels.
      </caption>

      <caption>
        One of the newest kids on the block, ethanol from corn or
        cellulose is produced by yeasts through alcoholic
        fermentation an anaerobic type of respiration.
      </caption>

      <caption>
        Yeasts are facultative anaerobes, which means that in the
        absence of oxygen, they use alcoholic fermentation to
        produce ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide. Both products are
        important commercially.
      </caption>

      <caption>
        We employ yeasts to use their anaerobic talents to help
        bread rise (via bubbles of CO2) and grapes ferment (adding
        ethanol).
