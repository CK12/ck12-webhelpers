<h2>The Coulomb Force Law</h2><p>The Coulomb Force Law states that any two charged particles <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%20%28q_1%2Cq_2%29%20" alt=" (q_1,q_2) " /> --- with charge measured in units of Coulombs --- at a distance <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%20r%20" alt=" r " /> from each other will experience a force of repulsion or attraction along the line joining them equal to: <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?blockmath=%0A%5Cvec%7BF_e%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bkq_1q_2%7D%7Br%5E2%7D%26%26%20%5Ctext%7BThe%20Coulomb%20Force%20%5B1%5D%7D%0A%5Cintertext%7BWhere%7D%0Ak%20%3D%208.987%20%5Ctimes%2010%5E9%20%5C%20%5Cmathrm%7BN%20%20%5Ccdot%20m%5E2%20%5Ccdot%20C%5E%7B-2%7D%7D.%20%26%26%5Ctext%7BThe%20Electric%20Constant%7D%0A" alt="

" /> This looks a lot like the Law of Universal Gravitation, which deals with attraction between objects with mass. The big difference is that while any two masses experience mutual <em>attraction</em>, two charges can either attract or repel each other, depending on whether the signs of their charges are alike:</p><p><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=116" width="256px" /></div></p><p>Like gravitational (and all other) forces, Coulomb forces add as vectors. Thus to find the force on a charge from an arrangement of charges, one needs to find the vector sum of the force from each charge in the arrangement.</p><h3>Example 1</h3><p><strong role="strong">Question</strong>: Two negatively charged spheres (one with <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=-12%5Cmu%5Cmathrm%7BC%7D" alt="-12\mu\mathrm{C}" />; the other with <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=-3%5Cmu%5Cmathrm%7BC%7D" alt="-3\mu\mathrm{C}" />) are <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=3%5Cmathrm%7Bm%7D" alt="3\mathrm{m}" /> apart. Where could you place an electron so that it will be suspended in space between them with a net force of zero (for this problem we will ignore the force of repulsion between the two charges because they are held in place)?</p><p><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=127" width="256px" /></div></p><p><strong role="strong">Answer</strong>: Consider the diagram above; here <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%20r_%7Bs%5Crightarrow%20e%7D%20" alt=" r_{s\rightarrow e} " /> is the distance between the electron and the small charge, while <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Cvec%7BF%7D_%7Bs%5Crightarrow%20e%7D%20" alt="\vec{F}_{s\rightarrow e} " /> is the force the electron feels due to it. For the electron to be balanced in between the two charges, the forces of repulsion caused by the two charges on the electron would have to be balanced. To do this, we will set the equation for the force exerted by two charges on each other equal and solve for a distance ratio. We will denote the difference between the charges through the subscripts "s" for the smaller charge, "e" for the electron, and "l" for the larger charge. <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?blockmath=%0A%5Cfrac%7Bkq_sq_e%7D%7Br_%7Bs%5Crightarrow%20e%7D%5E2%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7Bkq_lq_e%7D%7Br_%7Be%5Crightarrow%20l%7D%5E2%7D%0A" alt="
\frac{kq_sq_e}{r_{s\rightarrow e}^2}=\frac{kq_lq_e}{r_{e\rightarrow l}^2}
" /></p><p>Now we can cancel. The charge of the electron cancels. The constant <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=k" alt="k" /> also cancels. We can then replace the large and small charges with the numbers. This leaves us with the distances. We can then manipulate the equation to  produce a ratio of the distances. <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?blockmath=%0A%5Cfrac%7B-3%5Cmu%5Cmathrm%7BC%7D%7D%7Br_%7Bs%5Crightarrow%20e%7D%5E2%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7B-3%5Cmu%5Cmathrm%7BC%7D%7D%7Br_%7Be%5Crightarrow%20l%7D%5E2%7D%20%5CRightarrow%20%5Cfrac%7Br_%7Bs%5Crightarrow%20e%7D%5E2%7D%7Br_%7Be%5Crightarrow%20l%7D%5E2%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7B-12%5Cmu%5Cmathrm%7BC%7D%7D%7B-12%5Cmu%5Cmathrm%7BC%7D%7D%20%5CRightarrow%20%0A%5Cfrac%7Br_%7Bs%5Crightarrow%20e%7D%7D%7Br_%7Be%5Crightarrow%20l%7D%7D%3D%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%5Cmu%5Cmathrm%7BC%7D%7D%7B4%5Cmu%5Cmathrm%7BC%7D%7D%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%0A" alt="
\frac{-3\mu\mathrm{C}}{r_{s\rightarrow e}^2}=\frac{-3\mu\mathrm{C}}{r_{e\rightarrow l}^2} \Rightarrow \frac{r_{s\rightarrow e}^2}{r_{e\rightarrow l}^2}=\frac{-12\mu\mathrm{C}}{-12\mu\mathrm{C}} \Rightarrow 
\frac{r_{s\rightarrow e}}{r_{e\rightarrow l}}=\sqrt{\frac{1\mu\mathrm{C}}{4\mu\mathrm{C}}}=\frac{1}{2}
" /></p><p>Given this ratio, we know that the electron is twice as far from the large charge (<img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=-12%5Cmu%5Cmathrm%7BC%7D" alt="-12\mu\mathrm{C}" />) as from the small charge (<img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=-12%5Cmu%5Cmathrm%7BC%7D" alt="-12\mu\mathrm{C}" />). Given that the distance between the small and large charges is <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=3%5Cmathrm%7Bm%7D" alt="3\mathrm{m}" />, we can determine that the electron must be located <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=2%5Cmathrm%7Bm%7D" alt="2\mathrm{m}" /> away from the large charge and <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=1%5Cmathrm%7Bm%7D" alt="1\mathrm{m}" /> away from the smaller charge.</p><h3>Electric Fields and Electric Forces</h3><p>Gravity and the Coulomb force have a nice property in common: they can be represented by <strong role="strong">fields</strong>. Fields are a kind of bookkeeping tool used to keep track of forces. Take the electromagnetic force between two charges given above:  <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?blockmath=%5Cvec%7BF_e%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bkq_1q_2%7D%7Br%5E2%7D" alt="\vec{F_e} = \frac{kq_1q_2}{r^2}" /> If we are interested in the acceleration of the first charge only --- due to the force from the second charge --- we can rewrite this force as the product of <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%7Bq_1%7D%20" alt="{q_1} " /> and <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Cfrac%7Bkq_2%7D%7Br%5E2%7D" alt="\frac{kq_2}{r^2}" />. The first part of this product only depends on properties of the object we're interested in (the first charge), and the second part can be thought of as a property of the point in space where that object is.</p><p>In fact, the quantity <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Cfrac%7Bkq_2%7D%7Br%5E2%7D" alt="\frac{kq_2}{r^2}" /> captures everything about the electromagnetic force on any object possible at a distance <strong role="strong">r</strong> from <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%20q_2%20" alt=" q_2 " />. If we had replaced <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%20q_1%20" alt=" q_1 " /> with a different charge, <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%20q_3%20" alt=" q_3 " />, we would simply multiply <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%20q_3%20" alt=" q_3 " /> by <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Cfrac%7Bkq_2%7D%7Br%5E2%7D" alt="\frac{kq_2}{r^2}" /> to find the new force on the new charge. Such a  quantity, <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Cfrac%7Bkq_2%7D%7Br%5E2%7D" alt="\frac{kq_2}{r^2}" /> here, is referred to as the electric field from charge <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%20q_2%20" alt=" q_2 " /> at that point: in this case, it is the electric field due to a single charge: <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?blockmath=%0A%5Cvec%7BE_f%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bkq%7D%7Br%5E2%7D%20%26%26%5Ctext%7B%5B2%5D%20Electric%20field%20due%20to%20point%20charge%20%7D%20q%20%2C%5Ctext%7B%20distance%20%7D%20r%20%5Ctext%7B%20away%7D%20%0A" alt="

" /></p><p>The electric field is a vector quantity, and points in the direction that a force felt by a positive charge at that point would. If we are given the electric field at some point, it is just a matter of multiplication --- as illustrated above --- to find the force any charge <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%20q_0%20" alt=" q_0 " /> would feel at that point: <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?blockmath=%0A%5Cunderbrace%7B%5Cvec%7BF_e%7D%7D_%7B%5Ctext%7BForce%20on%20charge%20%7Dq_0%7D%20%3D%20%5Cunderbrace%7B%5Cvec%7BE_f%7D%7D_%7B%5Ctext%7BField%7D%7D%20%5Cunderbrace%7B%5Ctimes%20q_0%7D_%7B%5Ctext%7BCharge%7D%7D%20%26%26%5Ctext%7BForce%20on%20charge%20%7Dq_0%5Ctext%7B%20in%20an%20electric%20field%7D%0A" alt="

" /> Note that this is true for <em>all</em> electric fields, not just those from point charges. In general, the <strong role="strong">electric field</strong> at a point <em>is the force a </em><strong role="strong"><em>positive test charge of magnitude 1</em></strong><em> would feel at that point</em>. Any other charge will feel a force along the same line  (but possibly in the other direction) in proportion to its magnitude. In other words, the electric field can be though of as "force per unit charge".</p><p>In the case given above, the field was due to a single charge.  Such a field is shown in the figure below. Notice that this a field due to a positive charge, since the field arrows are pointing outward. The field produced by a point charge will be radially symmetric i.e., the strength of the field only depends on the distance, <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%20r%20" alt=" r " />, from the charge, not the direction;  the lengths of the arrows represent the strength of the field.</p><p><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=122" width="256px" /></div></p><h3>Example 2</h3><p><strong role="strong">Question</strong>: Calculate the electric field a distance of <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=4.0%5Cmathrm%7Bmm%7D" alt="4.0\mathrm{mm}" /> away from a <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=-2.0%5Cmu%20%5Cmathrm%7BC%7D" alt="-2.0\mu \mathrm{C}" /> charge.
