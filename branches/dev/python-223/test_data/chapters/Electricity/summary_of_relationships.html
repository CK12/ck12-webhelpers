Conversely, a field corresponds to a unique potential distribution up to an additive constant.  Remember though, it's relative potential between points not absolute potential that is physically relevant. In effect the field corresponds to a unique potential. In particular, we see that in the case of conservative forces the scalar potential (one degree of freedom per point) carries all information needed to determine the vector electric field (three degrees of freedom per point. The potential formulation is even more useful than it at first seems.</li></ul>
