<h2>Effects of Magnetic Fields</h2><h3>Force on a Charged Particle</h3><p>As moving charges create magnetic fields, so they experience forces from magnetic fields generated by other materials. The magnitude of the force experienced by a particle traveling in a magnetic field depends on the charge of the particle <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%20%28q%29%20" alt=" (q) " />, the velocity of the particle <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%20%28v%29%20" alt=" (v) " />, the strength of the field <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%28B%29%20" alt="(B) " />, and, importantly, the angle between their relative directions <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%20%28%5Ctheta%29" alt=" (\theta)" />: <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?blockmath=%20F_B%20%3D%20%20qvB%5Csin%7B%5Ctheta%7D%20%26%26%20%5Ctext%7B%5B3%5D%20Force%20on%20a%20Charged%20Particle%7D" alt=" F_B =  qvB\sin{\theta} && \text{[3] Force on a Charged Particle}" /> There is a <strong role="strong">second right hand rule</strong> that will show the direction of the force on a positive charge in a magnetic field: point your index finger along the direction of the particle&rsquo;s velocity . If your middle finger points along the magnetic field, your thumb will point in the direction of the force. NOTE: For negative charge reverse the direction of the force (or use your left hand)</p><p><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=160" width="256px" /></div></p><p>For instance, if a positively charged particle is moving to the right, and it enters a magnetic field pointing towards the top of your page, it feels a force going out of the page, while if a positively charged particle is moving to the left, and it enters a magnetic field pointing towards the top of your page, it feels a force going into the page:</p><p><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=168" width="256px" /></div></p><h4>Example 1: Find the Magnetic Field</h4><p><strong role="strong">Question</strong>: An electron is moving to the east at a speed of <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=1.8%5Ctimes10%5E6%5Cmathrm%7Bm/s%7D" alt="1.8\times10^6\mathrm{m/s}" />. It feels a force in the upward direction with a magnitude of <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=2.2%3F10%5E%7B-12%7D%5Cmathrm%7BN%7D" alt="2.2?10^{-12}\mathrm{N}" />. What is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field this electron just passed through?</p><p><strong role="strong">Answer</strong>: There are two parts to this question, the magnitude of the electric field and the direction. We will first focus on the magnitude.</p><p>To find the magnitude we will use the equation  <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?blockmath=%0AF_B%3DqvBsin%5Ctheta%0A" alt="
F_B=qvBsin\theta
" /> We were given the force of the magnetic field <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%282.2%3F10%5E%7B-12%7D%5Cmathrm%7BN%7D%29" alt="(2.2?10^{-12}\mathrm{N})" /> and the velocity that the electron is traveling <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%281.8%5Ctimes10%5E6%5Cmathrm%7Bm/s%7D%29" alt="(1.8\times10^6\mathrm{m/s})" />. We also know the charge of the electron <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%281.6%5Ctimes10%5E%7B-19%7D%5Cmathrm%7BC%7D%29" alt="(1.6\times10^{-19}\mathrm{C})" />. Also, because the electron's velocity is perpendicular to the field, we do not have to deal with <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Csin%5Ctheta" alt="\sin\theta" /> because <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Csin%5Ctheta" alt="\sin\theta" /> of <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=90" alt="90" /> degrees is <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=1" alt="1" />. Therefore all we have to do is solve for B and plug in the known values to get the answer. <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?blockmath=%0AF_B%3DqvB%5Csin%5Ctheta%0A%5Cintertext%7BSolving%20for%20B%3A%7D%0A%20B%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7BF_B%7D%7Bqv%5Csin%5Ctheta%7D%0A" alt="
F_B=qvB\sin\theta
\intertext{Solving for B:}
 B = \frac{F_B}{qv\sin\theta}
" /> Now, plugging the known values we have <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?blockmath=%0AB%3D%5Cfrac%7BF_B%7D%7Bqv%5Csin%5Ctheta%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7B2.2%3F10%5E%7B-12%7D%5Cmathrm%7BN%7D%7D%7B1.6%5Ctimes10%5E%7B-19%7D%5Cmathrm%7BC%7D%20%5Ctimes%201.8%5Ctimes10%5E6%5Cmathrm%7Bm/s%7D%5Ctimes1%7D%3D7.6%5Cmathrm%7BT%7D%0A" alt="
B=\frac{F_B}{qv\sin\theta}=\frac{2.2?10^{-12}\mathrm{N}}{1.6\times10^{-19}\mathrm{C} \times 1.8\times10^6\mathrm{m/s}\times1}=7.6\mathrm{T}
" /> Now we will find the direction of the field. We know the direction of the velocity (east) and the direction of the force due to the magnetic field (up, out of the page). Therefore we can use the second right hand rule (we will use the left hand, since an electron's charge is negative). Point the pointer finger to the right to represent the velocity and the thumb up to represent the force. This forces the middle finger, which represents the direction of the magnetic field, to point south. Alternatively, we could recognize that this situation is illustrated for a <em>positive</em> particle in the right half of the drawing above; for a negative particle to experience the same force, the field has to point in the opposite direction: south.</p><h4>Example 2: Circular Motion in Magnetic Fields</h4><p>Consider the following problem: a positively charged particle with an initial velocity of <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%20%5Cvec%7Bv%7D_1%20" alt=" \vec{v}_1 " />, charge <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%20q%20" alt=" q " /> and mass <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%20m%20" alt=" m " /> traveling in the plane of this page enters a region with a constant magnetic field <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%20%5Cvec%7BB%7D%20" alt=" \vec{B} " /> pointing into the page. We are interested in finding the trajectory of this particle.</p><p><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=166" width="256px" /></div></p><p>Since the force on a charged particle in a magnetic field is always perpendicular to both its velocity vector and the field vector (check this using the second right hand rule above), a <em>constant</em> magnetic field will provide a centripetal force --- that is, a constant force that is always directed perpendicular to the direction of motion. Two such force/velocity combinations are illustrated above. According to our study of rotational motion, this implies that as long as the particle does not leave the region of the magnetic field, it will travel in a circle. To find the radius of the circle, we set the magnitude of the centripetal force equal to the magnitude of the magnetic force and solve for <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%20r%20" alt=" r " />: <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?blockmath=%0AF_c%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bmv%5E2%7D%7Br%7D%20%3D%20F_B%20%3D%20qvB%5Csin%20%5Ctheta%20%3D%20qvB%0A%5Cintertext%7BTherefore%2C%7D%0Ar%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bmv%5E2%7D%7BqvB%7D%0A" alt="
F_c = \frac{mv^2}{r} = F_B = qvB\sin \theta = qvB
\intertext{Therefore,}
r = \frac{mv^2}{qvB}
" /></p><p>In the examples above, <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%20%5Ctheta%20" alt=" \theta " /> was conveniently 90 degrees, which made <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%20%5Csin%20%5Ctheta%20%3D%201" alt=" \sin \theta = 1" />. But that does not really matter; in a constant magnetic fields a different <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%20%5Ctheta%20" alt=" \theta " /> will simply decrease the force by a constant factor and will not change the qualitative behavior of the particle, since <em><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%20%5Ctheta%20" alt=" \theta " /> cannot change due to such a magnetic force.</em> (Why? Hint: what is the force perpendicular to? Read the paragraph above.)</p><h3>Force on a Wire</h3><p>Since a wire is nothing but a collection of moving charges, the force it will experience in a magnetic field will simply be the vector sum of the forces on the individual charges. If the wire is straight --- that is, all the charges are moving in the same direction --- these forces will all point in the same direction, and so will their sum. Then, the direction of the force can be found using the second right hand rule, while its magnitude will depend on the length of the wire (denoted <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%20L" alt=" L" />), the strength of the current, the strength of the field, and the angle between their directions:</p><p><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?blockmath=%20F_%7B%5Ctext%7Bwire%7D%7D%3D%20LIB%5Csin%28%5Ctheta%29%20%26%26%5Ctext%7B%5B4%5D%20Force%20on%20a%20Current%20Carrying%20Wire%7D" alt=" F_{\text{wire}}= LIB\sin(\theta) &&\text{[4] Force on a Current Carrying Wire}" /></p><p>Two current-carrying wires next to each other each generate magnetic fields and therefore exert forces on each other:</p><p><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=159" width="256px" /></div></p><p>By plugging equation [1] into equation [4], one can find the exact formula for this force (left to the reader --- make sure to remember that the two wires can have different currents).</p><h3>Electromagnetic Induction</h3><p>Changing magnetic fields passing through a loop of wire generate currents in that wire; this is how electric power generators work. Likewise, a changing current in a wire will create a changing magnetic field; this is how speakers and electric motors work.</p><p>To understand induction, we need to introduce the concept of <strong role="strong">electromagnetic flux</strong>. If you have a closed, looped wire of area <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=A" alt="A" /> (measured in <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%20%5Cmathrm%7Bm%5E2%7D%20" alt=" \mathrm{m^2} " />) and <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=N" alt="N" /> loops, and you pass a magnetic field <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=B" alt="B" /> through, the magnetic flux <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5CPhi" alt="\Phi" /> is given by the formula below. Again, the relative direction of the loops and the field matter; this relationship is preserved by creating an 'area vector': a vector whose magnitude is equal to the area of the loop and whose direction is perpendicular to the plane of the loop. The directions' influence can then be conveniently captured through a dot product: <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?blockmath=%20%5CPhi%20%3D%20N%20%5Cvec%7BB%7D%20%5Ccdot%20%5Cvec%7BA%7D%20%26%26%5Ctext%7B%5B5%5D%20Electromagnetic%20Flux%7D%20" alt=" \Phi = N \vec{B} \cdot \vec{A} &&\text{[5] Electromagnetic Flux} " /> The units of magnetic flux are <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Ctext%7BT%7D%20%5Ctimes%20%5Cmathrm%7Bm%5E2%7D" alt="\text{T} \times \mathrm{m^2}" />, also known as <strong role="strong">Webers</strong><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Ctext%7B%28Wb%29%7D" alt="\text{(Wb)}" />.</p><p><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=155" width="256px" /></div></p><p>In the example above, there are four loops of wire <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%28N%20%3D%204%29" alt="(N = 4)" /> and each has area <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Cpi%20r%5E2" alt="\pi r^2" /> (horizontally hashed). The magnetic field is pointing at an angle <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%20%5Ctheta%20" alt=" \theta " /> to the area vector. If the magnetic field has magnitude <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%20B%20" alt=" B " />, the flux through the loops will equal <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%204%20%5Ccos%20%5Ctheta%20B%20%5Cpi%20r%5E2" alt=" 4 \cos \theta B \pi r^2" />. Think of the magnetic flux as the part of the &ldquo;bundle&rdquo; of magnetic field lines &ldquo;held&rdquo; by the loop that points along the area vector.</p><p><em>If the magnetic flux through a loop or loops changes, electrons in the wire will feel a force, and this will generate a current</em>. The <em>induced voltage</em> (also called <strong role="strong">electromotive force, or emf</strong>) that they feel is equal to the change in flux <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Ctriangle%20%5CPhi" alt="\triangle \Phi" /> divided by the amount of time <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Ctriangle%20t" alt="\triangle t" /> that change took. This relationship is called Faraday&rsquo;s Law of Induction: <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?blockmath=%20emf%20%3D%20-%5Cfrac%7B%5CDelta%20%5CPhi%7D%7B%5CDelta%20t%7D%26%26%20%5Ctext%7B%5B6%5D%20Faraday%27s%20Law%20of%20Induction%7D%20" alt=" emf = -\frac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t}&& \text{[6] Faraday's Law of Induction} " /></p><p>The direction of the induced current is determined as follows: the current will flow so as to generate a magnetic field that <em>opposes</em> the change in flux. This is called Lenz&rsquo;s Law. Note that the electromotive force described above is not actually a force, since it is measured in Volts and acts like an induced potential difference. It was originally called that since it caused charged particles to move --- hence <em>electromotive</em> --- and the name stuck (it's somewhat analogous to calling an increase in a particle's gravitational potential energy difference a gravitomotive force). For practical (Ohm's Law, etc) purposes it can be treated like the voltage from a battery.</p><p>Since only a changing flux can produce an induced potential difference, one or more of the variables in equation [5] must be changing if the ammeter in the picture above is to register any current. Specifically, the following can all induce a current in the loops of wire:</p><ul><li>Changing the direction or magnitude of the magnetic field. </li><li>Changing the loops' orientation or area. </li><li>Moving the loops out of the region with the magnetic field. </li></ul><p> </p>
