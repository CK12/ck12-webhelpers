<h2>Sources of Magnetic Fields</h2><p>In the electricity chapter, we learned that static electric fields have, as their source, some arrangement of charges. On the other hand, there are no sources of magnetic charge: every magnet, no matter how small, has a 'north' and 'south' pole. Nonetheless, there exist 'magnetic materials' that create fields and experience forces from other magnetic materials. In this chapter, we study magnetic fields produced by two different phenomena.</p><h3>Permanent Magnets</h3><p>Permanent magnets (like refrigerator magnets) consist of atoms, such as iron, for which the magnetic moments (roughly electron spin) of the electrons are &ldquo;lined up&rdquo; all across the atom. This means that their magnetic fields add up, rather than canceling each other out. The net effect is noticeable because so many atoms have lined up. The magnetic field of such a magnet always points from the north pole to the south. The magnetic field of a bar magnet, for example, is illustrated below:</p><p><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=164" width="256px" /></div></p><p>If we were to cut the magnet above in half, it would still have north and south poles; the resulting magnetic field would be qualitatively the same as the one above (but weaker).</p><h3>Charged Particles in Motion (Wires)</h3><p>Charged particles in motion also generate magnetic fields. The most frequently used example is a current carrying wire, since current is literally moving charged particles. The magnitude of a field generated by a wire depends on distance to the wire and strength of the current <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%28I%29%20" alt="(I) " /> : <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?blockmath=B_%7B%5Ctext%7Bwire%7D%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cmu_0%20I%7D%7B2%20%5Cpi%20r%7D%26%26%20%5Ctext%7B%5B1%5D%20Magnetic%20field%20at%20a%20distance%20%7D%20r%20%5Ctext%7B%20from%20a%20current-carrying%20wire%7D%5C%5C%0A%5Ctext%7BWhere%20%7D%20%20%5Cmu_0%3D4%20%5Cpi%20%5Ctimes%2010%5E%7B-7%7D%20%5C%3B%5Ctext%7BTm/A%7D%20%26%26%5Ctext%7B%5B2%5D%20Permeability%20of%20Vacuum%20%28approximately%20same%20for%20air%20also%29%7D%0A%20" alt="B_{\text{wire}} = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 \pi r}&& \text{[1] Magnetic field at a distance } r \text{ from a current-carrying wire}\\

 " /> Meanwhile, its direction can be found using the so called <strong role="strong">first right hand rule</strong>: point your thumb in the direction of the current. Then, curl your fingers around the wire. The direction your fingers will point in the same direction as the field. Be sure to use your right hand!</p><p><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=162" width="256px" /></div></p><p>Sometimes, it is necessary to represent such three dimensional fields on a two dimensional sheet of paper. The following example illustrates how this is done.</p><p><div><img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/images?id=163" width="256px" /></div></p><p>In the example above, a current is running along a wire towards the top of your page. The magnetic field is circling the wire in loops that are pierced through the center by the current. Where these loops intersect this piece of paper, <em>we use the symbol <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Cbigodot" alt="\bigodot" /> to represent where the magnetic field is coming </em><strong role="strong"><em>out of the page</em></strong><em> and the symbol <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Cbigotimes" alt="\bigotimes" /> to represent where the magnetic field is going </em><strong role="strong"><em>into the page</em></strong><em>.</em> This convention can be used for all vector quantities: fields, forces, velocities, etc.</p>
