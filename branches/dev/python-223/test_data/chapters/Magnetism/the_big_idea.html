<h2>The Big Idea</h2><p>For static electric charges, the electromagnetic force is manifested by the Coulomb electric force alone.  If charges are moving, an additional force emerges, called magnetism.  The <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=19%5E%7Bth%7D" alt="19^{th}" /> century realization that electricity and magnetism are dual aspects of the same force completely changed our understanding of the world we live in. As with electricity, we use a field formulation to keep track of magnetic forces. Magnetic fields are usually denoted by the letter <img src="http://pioneer.ck12.org/flexr/api/ext/ucs/?math=%5Cvec%7BB%7D" alt="\vec{B}" /> and are measured in Teslas, in honor of the Serbian physicist Nikola Tesla; like electric fields, they are vector fields that contain energy, unlike electric fields, they have three dimensional properties and require some special vector rules to understand.</p><p>Insights due to Ampere, Gauss, and Maxwell led to the understanding that moving charges --- electric currents --- create magnetic fields. Varying magnetic fields create electric fields.  Thus a loop of wire in a changing magnetic field will have current induced in it.  This is called <strong role="strong">electromagnetic induction.</strong></p>
