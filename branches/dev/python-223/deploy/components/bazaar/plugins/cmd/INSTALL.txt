Installation of cmd plugin
---------------------------------

To install the plugin, you need to put this directory under your Bazaar
plugins folder (usually ``~/.bazaar/plugins``).  An easy way to do that
is to get the plugin, cmd.tgz, from CK-12 Foundation, and put it
under /tmp:

  $ cd ~/.bazaar/plugins
  $ tar zxf /tmp/cmd.tgz

The rest of the documentation is available by typing up bzr help cmd``
once the plugin is installed.
