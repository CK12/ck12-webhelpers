MAT.CA.8-12.ALG.11.0,,"Students apply basic factoring techniques to second-and simple third-degree polynomials. These techniques include finding a common factor for all terms in a polynomial, recognizing the difference of two squares, and recognizing perfect squares of binomials."
MAT.CA.8-12.ALG.12.0,,Students simplify fractions with polynomials in the numerator and denominator by factoring both and reducing them to the lowest terms.
MAT.CA.8-12.ALG.13.0,,"Students add, subtract, multiply, and divide rational expressions and functions. Students solve both computationally and conceptually challenging problems by using these techniques."
MAT.CA.8-12.ALG.14.0,,Students solve a quadratic equation by factoring or completing the square.
MAT.CA.8-12.ALG.15.0,,"Students apply algebraic techniques to solve rate problems, work problems, and percent mixture problems."
MAT.CA.8-12.ALG.16.0,,"Students understand the concepts of a relation and a function, determine whether a given relation defines a function, and give pertinent information about given relations and functions."
MAT.CA.8-12.ALG.17.0,,"Students determine the domain of independent variables and the range of dependent variables defined by a graph, a set of ordered pairs, or a symbolic expression."
MAT.CA.8-12.ALG.18.0,,"Students determine whether a relation defined by a graph, a set of ordered pairs, or a symbolic expression is a function and justify the conclusion."
MAT.CA.8-12.ALG.19.0,,Students know the quadratic formula and are familiar with its proof by completing the square.
MAT.CA.8-12.ALG.20.0,,Students use the quadratic formula to find the roots of a second-degree polynomial and to solve quadratic equations.
MAT.CA.8-12.ALG.21.0,,Students graph quadratic functions and know that their roots are the x- intercepts.
MAT.CA.8-12.ALG.22.0,,"Students use the quadratic formula or factoring techniques or both to determine whether the graph of a quadratic function will intersect the x-axis in zero, one, or two points."

MAT.CA.8-12.ALG.24.0,,Students use and know simple aspects of a logical argument:
MAT.CA.8-12.ALG.24.1,,Students explain the difference between inductive and deductive reasoning and identify and provide examples of each.
MAT.CA.8-12.ALG.24.2,,Students identify the hypothesis and conclusion in logical deduction.
MAT.CA.8-12.ALG.24.3,,Students use counterexamples to show that an assertion is false and recognize that a single counterexample is sufficient to refute an assertion.
MAT.CA.8-12.ALG.25.0,,"Students use properties of the number system to judge the validity of results, to justify each step of a procedure, and to prove or disprove statements:"
MAT.CA.8-12.ALG.25.1,,"Students use properties of numbers to construct simple, valid arguments (direct and indirect) for, or formulate counterexamples to, claimed assertions."
MAT.CA.8-12.ALG.25.2,,Students judge the validity of an argument according to whether the properties of the real number system and the order of operations have been applied correctly at each step.
MAT.CA.8-12.ALG.25.3,,"Given a specific algebraic statement involving linear, quadratic, or absolute value expressions or equations or inequalities, students determine whether the statement is true sometimes, always, or never."
