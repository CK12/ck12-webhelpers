<h1>Foundations of Life Science (Modified)</h1>
<p>
The modern era of biological research led to the founding of LSRF. By the late 1970s it became clear that the new biology would be relevant to research-oriented companies. The academic and commercial branches of chemistry and engineering have a long history of collaboration, but this had never been true of the biological sciences. For the first time, biologists were starting and leading companies that expected to apply this new powerful technology to the solution of problems that had previously been the province of chemists. The discoveries behind this revolution had been made exclusively in non-profit academic institutions, and it was academicians who first realized the commercial possibilities of biological research. In this new era, the non-profit and the for-profit constituencies of the life sciences have come together. Research-oriented companies now must keep up with the latest basic biology that takes place in academic institutions, and positions in industry have become a much more attractive option for academicians. The first class of LSRF fellows was awarded in 1983.
