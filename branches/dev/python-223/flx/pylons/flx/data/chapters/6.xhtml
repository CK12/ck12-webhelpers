  <h2>Significance of Newton's Laws</h2>

  <p>In the previous chapters, we studied the behavior of
  accelerating objects in one and two dimensions. We did not,
  however, address the issue of <em>where</em> the acceleration
  comes from: in other words, why, in certain situations, do the
  velocities of objects change? It might make sense that a cart
  moves if I push it, but what about a dropped object: is it
  accelerating for a different reason, or for the same one? Is
  there something common to <em>all</em> accelerating objects?</p>

  <p>Building on the insights of scientists before him, Isaac
  Newton created a mathematical analysis of moving and accelerating
  objects; the rules he discovered are now known as Newton's Laws
  of Motion. Newton is a legendary figure to physicists, and it's
  hard to underestimate his influence on the field. Actually, the
  substance of his Laws had been summarized by scientists before
  him. Still, the mathematical framework for their interpretation
  that Newton created was a revolutionary achievement, since it
  unified the existing knowledge of mechanics in a consistent
  system and cemented math as the accepted method of interpreting
  physical phenomena.</p>

  <p>Here are Newton's Laws, in modern English:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>Newton's First Law</strong></dt>

      <dd><em>Every body continues in its state of rest, or of
      uniform motion in a right (straight) line, unless it is
      compelled to change that state by forces impressed upon
      it.</em></dd>
    </dl>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>Newton's Third Law</strong></dt>

      <dd><em>To every action there is always opposed an equal
      reaction: or, the mutual actions of two bodies upon each
      other are always equal, and directed to contrary
      parts.</em></dd>

      <dt><strong>Newton's Second Law</strong></dt>

      <dd><em>The change of motion is proportional to the motive
      force impressed; and is made in the direction of the right
      (straight) line in which that force is impressed.</em></dd>
    </dl>
  </blockquote>

  <p>(Taken from the Principia in modern English, Isaac Newton,
  University of California Press, 1934).</p>

  <h2>Newton's Laws Explained</h2>

  <p>The <strong>First Law is about inertia; objects at rest stay
  at rest unless acted upon and objects in motion continue that
  motion in a straight line unless acted upon</strong>. Prior to
  Newton and Galileo, the prevailing view on motion was still
  Aristotle's. According to his theory the natural state of things
  is at rest; force is required to keep something moving at a
  constant rate. This made sense to people throughout history
  because on earth, friction and air resistance slow moving
  objects. When there is no air resistance (or other sources of
  friction), a situation approximated in space, Newton's first law
  is much more evident.</p>

  <p>The "motion" Newton mentions in the Second Law is, in his
  language, the product of the mass and velocity of an object ---
  we call this quantity momentum --- so <strong>the Second Law is
  actually the</strong> famous equation<strong>:</strong>
  <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0A%5Cvec%7BF%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5CDelta%28m%5Cvec%7Bv%7D%29%7D%7B%5CDelta%20t%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bm%5CDelta%20%5Cvec%7Bv%7D%7D%7B%5CDelta%20t%7D%20%3Dm%5Cvec%7Ba%7D%20%26%26%20%5Ctext%7B%5B1%5D%7D%0A"
  alt=
  "\vec{F} = \frac{\Delta(m\vec{v})}{\Delta t} = \frac{m\Delta \vec{v}}{\Delta t} =m\vec{a} &amp;&amp; \text{[1]}">
  That is, the acceleration experienced by an object will be
  proportional to the applied force and inversely proportional to
  its mass. If there are multiple forces, they can be added as
  vectors and it is the <em>net</em> force that matters:
  <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0A%09%09%20m%5Cvec%7Ba%7D%20%3D%20%5Cvec%7BF_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bnet%7D%7D%7D%20%3D%20%5Csum_%7Bi%7D%20%5Cvec%7BF_i%7D%20%26%26%20%5Cmathrm%7BNet%7Eforce%7Eis%7Ethe%7Evector%7Esum%7Eof%7Eall%7Ethe%7Eforces%7D%5C%5C%0A%09%09%20m%7Ba%7D_%7Bx%7D%20%3D%20F_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bnet%2C%7E%7Dx%7D%20%3D%20%5Csum_%7Bi%7D%20%7BF_%7Bix%7D%7D%20%26%26%20%5Cmathrm%7BHorizontal%7Ecomponents%7Eadd%7D%5C%5C%0A%09%09m%7Ba%7D_%7By%7D%20%3D%20F_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bnet%2C%7E%7Dy%7D%20%3D%20%5Csum_%7Bi%7D%20%7BF_%7Biy%7D%7D%20%20%26%26%20%5Cmathrm%7BAs%7Edo%7Evertical%7Eones%7D%0A"

  When the net force on an object is zero, it is said to be in
  <strong>translational equilibrium</strong>: <img class=
  "x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0A%5Csum_%7Bi%7D%20%5Cvec%7BF_i%7D%20%3D%200%20%26%26%20%5Ctext%7BTranslational%20Equilibrium%20Condition%20%5B2%5D%7D%5C%5C%0A"
  alt=
  "\sum_{i} \vec{F_i} = 0 &amp;&amp; \text{Translational Equilibrium Condition [2]}\\"></p>

  <p>Finally, the <strong>Third Law states that you can't push
  someone or something without being pushed back</strong>. This law
  is somewhat confusing: if to each applied force there is an equal
  and opposite force, why does anything ever accelerate? The key is
  that the `equal and opposite' forces act on different objects. If
  I push a cart, the cart is in turn pushing on me. However, I'm
  also pushing (and being pushed by) <em>the earth</em>, through my
  feet. Therefore, in the end, the cart and I move in the same
  direction and the earth moves opposite us. The cart-person system
  experienced a net force in one direction, while the earth
  experienced an equal and opposite force. According to Newton's
  <em>second</em> law, the acceleration objects experience due to
  applied forces is inversely proportional to their mass; clearly,
  the earth --- with its gigantic mass --- doesn't move very far
  compared to the cart and person.</p>

  <h3>Newton's Laws Example</h3>

  <p><strong>Question</strong>: Tom and Mary are standing on
  identical skateboards. Tom and Mary push off of each other and
  travel in opposite directions.</p>

  <p>a) If Tom <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%28M%29" alt="(M)"> and Mary <img class=
  "x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%28m%29" alt="(m)"> have
  identical masses, who travels farther?</p>

  <p>b) If Tom has a bigger mass than Mary, who goes farther?</p>

  <p>c) If Tom and Mary have identical masses and Tom pushes twice
  as hard as Mary, who goes farther?</p>

  <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

  <p>a) Neither. Both Tom and Mary will travel the same distance.
  The forced applied to each person is the same (Newton's Third
  Law). So <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0A%5Ccancel%7BM%7Da%3D%5Ccancel%7Bm%7D%7Ba%7D%0A"
  alt="\cancel{M}a=\cancel{m}{a}"> which cancels to <img class=
  "x-ck12-block-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0Aa%3Da%0A"
  alt="a=a"> Therefore both people will travel the same distance
  because the acceleration controls how far someone will travel and
  Tom and Mary have equal acceleration.</p>

  <p>b) Mary will go farther. Again, the same force is applied to
  both Mary and Tom so <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0AMa%3Dma%0A" alt="Ma=ma"> Since Tom
  has the larger mass, his acceleration must be smaller
  (acceleration and mass are inversely proportional). Finally,
  because Mary's acceleration is greater, she will travel
  farther.</p>

  <p>c) Neither. Newton's Third Law states that for every action
  there is an equal and opposite reaction. Therefore if Tom pushes
  twice as hard as Mary, Mary will essentially be pushing back with
  the same strength. They will therefore travel the same
  distance.</p>

  <h2>What are Forces?</h2>

  <p>In other words, things tend to stay in the their current state
  of motion unless some "forces" are "impressed" on them. But where
  do such forces come from? <em>What</em> are they? <strong>Force
  isn't a real</strong> <strong><em>object</em></strong><strong>,
  but rather a</strong> <strong><em>concept</em></strong>
  <strong>used to describe actions</strong>. We can think of it as
  the cause of any kind of "pushing" or "pulling" that an object
  experiences. As long as we can measure them consistently, forces
  can be treated like any other physical vector quantity. One way
  to state a major goal of physics is to find a method for
  consistently predicting the forces an object will experience
  under any circumstances, based on the circumstances. At this
  point, physicists have identified four basic forces that govern
  the universe:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>The strong force</strong>: The most powerful of the
    four forces, it holds nuclei together in atoms --- but has a
    very short range. It has to overcome the massive
    electromagnetic repulsion between protons in a nucleus.</li>

    <li><strong>The electromagnetic force</strong>: Responsible for
    the behavior of charged particles. Has infinite range.</li>

    <li><strong>The weak force</strong>: Another nuclear force,
    responsible for much of the structure of stars and the universe
    in general. Its range is longer than that of the strong force,
    but still smaller than an atom.</li>

    <li><strong>Gravity</strong>: Responsible for the attraction of
    all masses in the universe. Has infinite range.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>All others --- friction, air resistance, and other contact
  forces; buoyancy; the spring force --- can be reduced to these
  fundamental forces. The fundamental forces are covered in more
  detail in later chapters.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Note that this classification does not tell us anything about
  <em>where</em> these forces come from, or how they are able to
  act seemingly at a distance, with "no strings attached". Newton
  himself said:</p>

  <blockquote>
    I have not as yet been able to discover the reason for these
    properties of gravity from phenomena, and I do not feign
    hypotheses.
  </blockquote>

  <p>In other words, we are interested in describing and predicting
  nature, rather than explaining its root causes. Forces acting a
  distance may seem strange in light of our experience with forces
  that <em>we</em> can apply to things (like pushing on rocks,
  etc), but to Newton asking about the nature of gravity was like
  asking about the nature of mass: it's just there, we can measure
  it, and that's it.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h2>Common Forces</h2>

  <h3>Universal Gravity</h3>

  <p>In previous chapters we learned that gravity --- near the
  surface of planets, at least --- is a force that accelerates
  objects at a constant rate. At this point we can extend this
  description using the framework of Newton's Laws.</p>

  <p>Newton's Laws apply to all forces; but when he developed them
  only one was known: gravity. Newton's major insight --- and one
  of the greatest in the history of science --- was that the same
  force that causes objects to fall when released is also
  responsible for keeping the planets in orbit. According to some
  sources, he realized this while taking a stroll through some
  gardens and witnessing a falling apple.</p>

  <p>After considering the implications of this unification, Newton
  formulated the <strong>Law of Universal Gravitation</strong>: Any
  two objects in the universe, with masses <img class="x-ck12-math"
  src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20m_1%20" alt=" m_1 "> and <img class=
  "x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20m_2%20" alt=" m_2 ">
  with their centers of mass at a distance <img class="x-ck12-math"
  src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20r%20" alt=" r "> apart will
  experience a force of mutual attraction along the line joining
  their centers of mass equal to: <img class="x-ck12-block-math"
  src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0A%5Cvec%7BF_G%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7BGm_1m_2%7D%7Br%5E2%7D%20%26%26%20%5Ctext%7BUniversal%20Gravitation%20%5B3%5D%2C%20%7D%0A%5Cintertext%7Bwhere%20G%20is%20the%20Gravitational%20constant%3A%7D%0AG%20%3D%206.67300%5Ctimes10%5E%7B-11%7D%20%5Cmathrm%7Bm%5E3%20kg%5E%7B-1%7D%20s%5E%7B-2%7D%7D%0A"

  Here is an illustration of this law for two objects, for instance
  the earth and the sun:</p>

  <p><img src="/rpc/ck12/images?id=43" alt="" width="300px"></p>

  <h3>Gravity on the Earth's Surface</h3>

  <p>In the chapter on energy, we saw that the gravitational
  potential energy formula for objects near earth, <img class=
  "x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=U_g%20%3D%20%20mgh%20"
  alt="U_g = mgh ">, is a special case of a more general result. It
  so happens that the fact that gravity accelerates near earth
  objects at a constant rate is an almost identical result.</p>

  <p>On the surface of a planet --- such as earth --- the
  <img class="x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20r%20" alt=
  " r "> in formula [3] is very close to the radius of the planet,
  since a planet's center of mass is --- usually --- at its center.
  It also does not vary by much: for instance, the earth's radius
  is about 6,000 km, while the heights we consider for this book
  are on the order of at most a few kilometers --- so we can say
  that for objects near the surface of the earth, the <img class=
  "x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20r%20" alt=" r "> in
  formula [3] is constant and equal to the earth's radius. This
  allows us to say that gravity is more or less constant on the
  surface of the earth. Here's an illustration:</p>

  <p><img src="/rpc/ck12/images?id=56" alt="" width="300px"></p>

  <p>For any object a height <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20h%20" alt=" h "> above the surface of the
  earth, the force of gravity may be expressed as: <img class=
  "x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0A%5Cvec%7BF_G%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7BGm_%7Bearth%7Dm_%7Bobj%7D%7D%7B%28r_%7Bearth%7D%2Bh%29%5E2%7D%20%5Ctext%7B%20%5B4%5D%7D%0A%5Cintertext%7BNow%20we%20make%20the%20approximation%20that%7D%0Ar_%7Bearth%7D%2Bh%20%5Capprox%20r_%7Bearth%7D%0A%5Cintertext%7Bthen%2C%20we%20can%20rewrite%20%5B4%5D%20as%7D%0A%5Cvec%7BF_G%7D%20%3D%20%5Cunderbrace%7B%5Cfrac%7BGm_%7Bearth%7D%7D%7Br_%7Bearth%7D%5E2%7D%7D_%7B%5Cvec%7Bg_%7Bearth%7D%7D%7D%5Ctimes%20m_%7Bobj%7D%20%3D%20m_%7Bobj%7D%5Ctimes%7B%5Cvec%7Bg%7D%7D%26%26%5Ctext%7B%5B4%5D%20Gravity%20on%20Earth%7D%0A"

  We can do this because the quantity in braces only has constants;
  we can combine them and call their product <img class=
  "x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20g%20" alt=" g ">.
  Remember, <em>this is an approximation that holds</em>
  <strong><em>only</em></strong> <em>when the <img class=
  "x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20r%20" alt=" r "> in
  formula [3] is more or less constant.</em></p>

  <p>We call the quantity <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20mg%20" alt=" mg "> an object's
  <strong>weight</strong>. Weight is different from mass --- which
  is identical everywhere --- since it depends on the gravitational
  force an object experiences. In fact, weight is the magnitude of
  that force. To find the weight of an object on another planet,
  star, or moon, use the appropriate values in formula [4].</p>

  <h3>Normal Force</h3>

  <p>Often, objects experience gravitational attraction but cannot
  move closer together because they are in contact. For instance,
  when you stand on the surface of the earth you are obviously not
  accelerating toward its center. According to Newton's Laws, there
  must be a force opposing gravity, so that the net force on both
  objects is zero. We call such a force the <strong>Normal
  Force</strong>. It is actually electromagnetic in nature (like
  other contact forces), and arises due to the repulsion of atoms
  in the two objects. Here is an illustration of the Normal force
  on a block sitting on earth:</p>

  <p><img src="/rpc/ck12/images?id=44" alt="" width="250px"></p>

  <h3>Gravity and Normal Force Example</h3>

  <p><strong>Question</strong>: A woman of mass 70.0 kg weighs
  herself in an elevator.</p>

  <p><img src="/rpc/ck12/images?id=50" alt="" width="150px"></p>

  <dl>
    <dd>c) When the elevator is accelerating upward at 2.00
    m/s<sup>2</sup>, what does the scale read?</dd>

    <dd>b) When the elevator is not accelerating, what does the
    scale read (i.e., what is the normal force that the scale
    exerts on the woman)?</dd>

    <dd>a) If she wants to weigh less, should she weigh herself
    when accelerating upward or downward?</dd>
  </dl>

  <p><strong>Answer</strong> a) If she wants to weigh less, she has
  to decrease her force (her weight is the force) on the scale. We
  will use the equation <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0AF%3Dma%0A" alt="F=ma"> to determine
  in which situation she exerts less force on the scale.</p>

  <p>If the elevator is accelerating upward then the acceleration
  would be greater. She would be pushed toward the floor of the
  elevator making her weight increase. Therefore, she should weigh
  herself when the elevator is going down.</p>

  <p>b) When the elevator is not accelerating, the scale would read
  <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=70.0%5Cmathrm%7Bkg%7D" alt=
  "70.0\mathrm{kg}">.</p>

  <p>c) If the elevator was accelerating upward at a speed of
  <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=2.00%5Cmathrm%7Bm/s%5E2%7D" alt=
  "2.00\mathrm{m/s^2}">, then the scale would read <img class=
  "x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0AF%3Dma%3D70%5Cmathrm%7Bkg%7D%5Ctimes%20%289.8%5Cmathrm%7Bm/s%5E2%7D%2B2%5Cmathrm%7Bm/s%5E2%7D%29%3D826%5Cmathrm%7BN%7D%0A"
  alt=
  "F=ma=70\mathrm{kg}\times (9.8\mathrm{m/s^2}+2\mathrm{m/s^2})=826\mathrm{N}">
  which is <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=82.6%5Cmathrm%7Bkg%7D" alt=
  "82.6\mathrm{kg}">.</p>

  <h3>Tension</h3>

  <p>Another force that often opposes gravity is known as
  <strong>tension</strong>. This force is provided by wires and
  strings when they hold objects above the earth. Like the Normal
  Force, it is electromagnetic in nature and arises due to the
  intermolecular bonds in the wire or string:</p>

  <p><img src="/rpc/ck12/images?id=32" alt="" width="200px"></p>

  <p>If the object is in equilibrium, tension must be equal in
  magnitude and opposite in direction to gravity. This force
  transfers the gravity acting on the object to whatever the wire
  or string is attached to; in the end it is usually a Normal Force
  --- between the earth and whatever the wire is attached to ---
  that ends up balancing out the force of gravity on the
  object.</p>

  <h3>Friction</h3>

  <p>Friction is a force that opposes motion. Any two objects in
  contact have what is called a mutual coefficient of friction. To
  find the force of friction between them, we multiply the normal
  force by this coefficient. Like the forces above, it arises due
  to electromagnetic interactions of atoms in two objects. There
  are actually two coefficients of friction: static and kinetic.
  Static friction will oppose <em>initial</em> motion of two
  objects relative to each other. Once the objects are moving,
  however, kinetic friction will oppose their continuing motion.
  Kinetic friction is lower than static friction, so it is easier
  to keep an object in motion than to set it in motion. <img class=
  "x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0Af_s%20%5Cle%20%5Cmu_s%20%7C%20%5Cvec%7BF_N%7D%7C%20%26%26%20%5Cmathrm%7B%5B5%5D%7EStatic%7Efriction%7Eopposes%7Epotential%7Emotion%7Eof%7Esurfaces%7Ein%7Econtact%7D%5C%5C%0Af_k%20%3D%20%5Cmu_k%20%7C%20%5Cvec%7BF_N%7D%7C%20%26%26%20%5Cmathrm%7B%5B6%5D%7EKinetic%7Efrictions%7Eopposes%7Emotion%7Eof%7Esurfaces%7Ein%7Econtact%7D%0A"
  alt=
  "f_s \le \mu_s | \vec{F_N}| &amp;&amp; \mathrm{[5]~Static~friction~opposes~potential~motion~of~surfaces~in~contact}\\ f_k = \mu_k | \vec{F_N}| &amp;&amp; \mathrm{[6]~Kinetic~frictions~opposes~motion~of~surfaces~in~contact}">
  There are some things about friction that are not very
  intuitive:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The magnitude of the friction force does not depend on the
    surface areas in contact.</li>

    <li>The magnitude of kinetic friction does not depend on the
    relative velocity or acceleration of the two objects.</li>

    <li>Friction always points in the direction opposing motion. If
    the net force (not counting friction) on an object is lower
    than the maximum possible value of static friction, friction
    will be equal to the net force in magnitude and opposite in
    direction.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h3>Spring Force</h3>

  <p>Finally, the last force we will cover is that exerted by a
  stretched spring. Any spring has some equilibrium length, and if
  stretched in either direction it will push or pull with a force
  equal to: <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0A%5Cvec%7BF_%7Bsp%7D%7D%20%3D%20-k%20%5Cvec%7B%5CDelta%20x%7D%20%20%26%26%20%5Cmathrm%7B%5B7%5D%7EForce%7Eof%7Espring%7E%7D%5Cvec%7B%5CDelta%20x%7D%5Cmathrm%7B%7Efrom%7Eequilibrium%7D%0A"
  alt=

  <h2>Short Summary</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>An object will not change its state of motion (i.e.,
    accelerate) unless an unbalanced force acts on it. Equal and
    oppositely directed forces on the same object do not produce
    acceleration.</li>

    <li>The force of gravity is called weight. Near the surface of
    a planet, it has magnitude <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
    "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20mg%20" alt=" mg "> and is directed
    perpendicular to its surface. This <img class="x-ck12-math"
    src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20g%20" alt=" g "> is different from
    the Gravitational Constant, and differs from planet to
    planet.</li>

    <li>Your mass does not change when you move to other planets
    --- although your weight does --- because mass is a measure of
    how much <em>matter</em> your body contains, and not how much
    gravitational force you feel.</li>

    <li>To calculate the net force on an object, you need to
    calculate all the individual forces acting on the object and
    then add them as vectors.</li>

    <li>Newton&rsquo;s Third Law states for every force there is an
    equal but opposite reaction force. To distinguish a third law
    pair from merely oppositely directed pairs is difficult, but
    very important. Third law pairs must obey three rules: (1)
    Third law force pairs must be of the same type of force. (2)
    Third law force pairs are exerted on two different objects. (3)
    Third law force pairs are equal in magnitude and oppositely
    directed. <em>Example:</em> A block sits on a table. The
    Earth&rsquo;s gravity on the block and the force of the table
    on the block are equal and opposite. <strong>But these are not
    third law pairs,</strong> because they are both on the same
    object and the forces are of different types. The proper third
    law pairs are: (1) earth&rsquo;s gravity on block/block&rsquo;s
    gravity on earth and (2) table pushes on block/ block pushes on
    table.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Free-Body Diagram Example</h2>

  <p><strong>Question</strong>: Using the diagram below, find the
  net force on the block. The block weighs <img class="x-ck12-math"
  src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=3%5Cmathrm%7Bkg%7D" alt="3\mathrm{kg}">
  and the inclined plane has a coefficient of friction of
  <img class="x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=.6" alt=
  ".6">.</p>

  <p><img src="/rpc/ck12/images?id=37" alt="" width="300px"></p>

  <p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>

  <p>The first step to solving a Newton's Laws problem is to
  identify the object in question. In our case, the block on the
  slope is the object of interest.</p>

  <p>Next, we need to draw a free-body diagram. To do this, we need
  to identify all of the forces acting on the block and their
  direction. The forces are friction, which acts in the negative x
  direction, the normal force, which acts in the positive y
  direction, and gravity, which acts in a combination of the
  negative y direction and the positive x direction. Notice that we
  have rotated the picture so that the majority of the forces
  acting on the block are along the y or x axis. This does not
  change the answer to the problem because the direction of the
  forces is still the same relative to each other. When we have
  determined our answer, we can simply rotate it back to the
  original position.</p>

  <p>Now we need to break down gravity (the only force not along
  one of the axises) into its component vectors (which do follow
  the axises). <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0A%5Cmathrm%7BThe%7Ex%7Ecomponent%7Eof%7Egravity%3A%7D%7E9.8%5Cmathrm%7Bm/%7Bs%5E2%7D%7D%5Ctimes%20cos%7B60%7D%3D4.9%5Cmathrm%7Bm/%7Bs%5E2%7D%7D%5C%5C%0A%5Cmathrm%7BThe%7Ey%7Ecomponent%7Eof%7Egravity%3A%7D%7E9.8%5Cmathrm%7Bm/%7Bs%5E2%7D%7D%5Ctimes%20sin%7B60%7D%3D8.5%5Cmathrm%7Bm/%7Bs%5E2%7D%7D%0A"
  alt=
  "\mathrm{The~x~component~of~gravity:}~9.8\mathrm{m/{s^2}}\times cos{60}=4.9\mathrm{m/{s^2}}\\ \mathrm{The~y~component~of~gravity:}~9.8\mathrm{m/{s^2}}\times sin{60}=8.5\mathrm{m/{s^2}}">
  Yet these are only the acceleration of gravity so we need to
  multiply them by the weight of the block to get the force.
  <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0AF%3Dma%3D3%5Cmathrm%7Bkg%7D%5Ctimes%204.9%5Cmathrm%7Bm/%7Bs%5E2%7D%7D%3D14.7%5Cmathrm%7BN%7D%0AF%3Dma%3D3%5Cmathrm%7Bkg%7D%5Ctimes%208.5%5Cmathrm%7Bm/%7Bs%5E2%7D%7D%3D25.5%5Cmathrm%7BN%7D%0A"

  <p>Now that we have solved for the force of the y-component of
  gravity we know the normal force (they are equal). Therefore the
  normal force is <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=25.5%20%5Cmathrm%7BN%7D" alt=
  "25.5 \mathrm{N}">. Now that we have the normal force and the
  coefficient of static friction, we can find the force of
  friction. <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0AF_s%3D%5Cmu%20_sF_N%3D.6%5Ctimes%2025.5%5Cmathrm%7BN%7D%3D15.3%5Cmathrm%7BN%7D%0A"
  alt="F_s=\mu _sF_N=.6\times 25.5\mathrm{N}=15.3\mathrm{N}"></p>

  <p>The force of static friction is greater than the component of
  gravity that is forcing the block down the inclined plane.
  Therefore the force of friction will match the force of the
  x-component of gravity. So the net force on the block is
  <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=

  Therefore the net force on the block is <img class="x-ck12-math"

      <p>Here&rsquo;s the situation: both springs are compressed by
      an amount <img class="x-ck12-math" src=

      <img class="x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=L" alt="L">
      is fixed to both the top plate and the bottom plate. The two
      springs, each with spring constant <img class="x-ck12-math"
      src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=k" alt="k">, are wrapped around the
      rod on both sides of the middle plate, but are free to move
      because they are not attached to the rod or the plates. The
      middle plate has negligible mass, and is constrained in its
      motion by the compression forces of the top and bottom
      springs.</p>

      <p>The medical implementation of this device is to screw the
      top plate to one vertebrae and the middle plate to the
      vertebrae directly below. The bottom plate is suspended in
      space. Instead of fusing broken vertebrates together, this
      implant allows movement somewhat analogous to the natural
      movement of functioning vertebrae. Below you will do the
      exact calculations that an engineer did to get this device

    <li>A stunt driver is approaching a cliff at very high speed.
    Sensors in his car have measured the acceleration and velocity
    of the car, as well as all forces acting on it, for various
    times. The driver&rsquo;s motion can be broken down into the
    following steps:

      <p>Step 1: The driver, beginning at rest, accelerates his car
      on a horizontal road for ten seconds. Sensors show that there
      is a force in the direction of motion of <img class=

      src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=1000%20%5C%3B%5Cmathrm%7BN%7D" alt=

      "1250 \;\mathrm{kg}">.</p>

      <p>Step 2: Approaching the cliff, the driver takes his foot
      off of the gas pedal (There is no further force in the
      direction of motion.) and brakes, increasing the force
      opposing motion from <img class="x-ck12-math" src=

        <li>Ignoring air resistance, how long is the stunt driver
        in the air?</li>

        <li>For Step 1:

          <ol>
            <li>Draw a free body diagram, naming all the forces on
            the car.</li>

            <li>Calculate the magnitude of the net force.</li>

            <li>Find the change in velocity over the stated time
            period.</li>

            <li>Make a graph of velocity in the <img class=
            "x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=x-" alt=
            "x-">direction vs. time over the stated time
            period.</li>

            <li>Calculate the distance the driver covered in the
            stated time period. Do this by finding the area under
            the curve in your graph of (iv). Then, check your
            result by using the equations for kinematics.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>Repeat (b) for Step 2.</li>

        <li>Calculate the distance that the stunt driver should
        land from the bottom of the cliff.</li>
      </ol>

    <li>You are pulling open a stuck drawer, but since you&rsquo;re
    a physics geek you&rsquo;re pulling it open with an electronic
    device that measures force! You measure the following behavior.
    The drawer has a weight of <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
    "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=7%5C%3B%5Cmathrm%7BN%7D" alt=
    "7\;\mathrm{N}">.

      <p><img src="/rpc/ck12/images?id=52" alt="" width=

    </li>

    <li>Draw arrows representing the <strong>forces</strong> acting
    on the cannonball as it flies through the air. Assume that air
    resistance is small compared to gravity, but not negligible.

    <li>A tug of war erupts between you and your sweetie. Assume
    your mass is 60 kg and the coefficient of friction between your
    feet and the ground is <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
    "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=0.5" alt="0.5"> (good shoes). Your
    sweetie&rsquo;s mass is <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
    "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=85%20%5C%3B%5Cmathrm%7Bkg%7D" alt=
    "85 \;\mathrm{kg}"> and the coefficient of friction between
    his/her feet and the ground is <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
    "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=0.35" alt="0.35"> (socks). Who is going to
    win? Explain, making use of a calculation.</li>

    <li>A block has a little block hanging out to its side, as
    shown:

      <p><img src="/rpc/ck12/images?id=55" alt="" width="240px">As
      you know, if the situation is left like this, the little
      block will just fall. But if we accelerate the leftmost block
      to the right, this will create a normal force between the
      little block and the big block, and if there is a coefficient
      of friction between them, then the little block won&rsquo;t
      slide down! Clever, eh?</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The mass of the little block is <img class=
        "x-ck12-math" src=
        "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=0.15%20%5C%3B%5Cmathrm%7Bkg%7D" alt=
        "0.15 \;\mathrm{kg}">. What frictional force is required to
        keep it from falling? (State a magnitude and
        direction.)</li>

        <li>If both blocks are accelerating to the right with an
        acceleration <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
        "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=a%20%3D%2014.0%20%5C%3B%5Cmathrm%7Bm/s%7D%5E2"
        alt="a = 14.0 \;\mathrm{m/s}^2">, what is the normal force
        on the little block provided by the big block?</li>

        <li>What is the minimum coefficient of static friction
        required?</li>
      </ol>
