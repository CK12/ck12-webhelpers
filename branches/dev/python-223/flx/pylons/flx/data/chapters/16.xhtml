  <h2>The Big Idea</h2>

  <p>For static electric charges, the electromagnetic force is
  manifested by the Coulomb electric force alone. If charges are
  moving, an additional force emerges, called magnetism. The
  <img class="x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=19%5E%7Bth%7D"
  alt="19^{th}"> century realization that electricity and magnetism
  are dual aspects of the same force completely changed our
  understanding of the world we live in. As with electricity, we
  use a field formulation to keep track of magnetic forces.
  Magnetic fields are usually denoted by the letter <img class=
  "x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%5Cvec%7BB%7D" alt=
  "\vec{B}"> and are measured in Teslas, in honor of the Serbian
  physicist Nikola Tesla; like electric fields, they are vector
  fields that contain energy, unlike electric fields, they have
  three dimensional properties and require some special vector
  rules to understand.</p>

  <p>Insights due to Ampere, Gauss, and Maxwell led to the
  understanding that moving charges --- electric currents ---
  create magnetic fields. Varying magnetic fields create electric
  fields. Thus a loop of wire in a changing magnetic field will
  have current induced in it. This is called
  <strong>electromagnetic induction.</strong></p>

  <h2>Sources of Magnetic Fields</h2>

  <p>In the electricity chapter, we learned that static electric
  fields have, as their source, some arrangement of charges. On the
  other hand, there are no sources of magnetic charge: every
  magnet, no matter how small, has a 'north' and 'south' pole.
  Nonetheless, there exist 'magnetic materials' that create fields
  and experience forces from other magnetic materials. In this
  chapter, we study magnetic fields produced by two different
  phenomena.</p>

  <h3>Permanent Magnets</h3>

  <p>Permanent magnets (like refrigerator magnets) consist of
  atoms, such as iron, for which the magnetic moments (roughly
  electron spin) of the electrons are &ldquo;lined up&rdquo; all
  across the atom. This means that their magnetic fields add up,
  rather than canceling each other out. The net effect is
  noticeable because so many atoms have lined up. The magnetic
  field of such a magnet always points from the north pole to the
  south. The magnetic field of a bar magnet, for example, is
  illustrated below:</p>

  <p><img src="/rpc/ck12/images?id=164" alt="" width="200px"></p>

  <p>If we were to cut the magnet above in half, it would still
  have north and south poles; the resulting magnetic field would be
  qualitatively the same as the one above (but weaker).</p>

  <h3>Charged Particles in Motion (Wires)</h3>

  <p>Charged particles in motion also generate magnetic fields. The
  most frequently used example is a current carrying wire, since
  current is literally moving charged particles. The magnitude of a
  field generated by a wire depends on distance to the wire and
  strength of the current <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%28I%29%20" alt="(I) "> : <img class=
  "x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=B_%7B%5Ctext%7Bwire%7D%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cmu_0%20I%7D%7B2%20%5Cpi%20r%7D%26%26%20%5Ctext%7B%5B1%5D%20Magnetic%20field%20at%20a%20distance%20%7D%20r%20%5Ctext%7B%20from%20a%20current-carrying%20wire%7D%5C%5C%0A%5Ctext%7BWhere%20%7D%20%20%5Cmu_0%3D4%20%5Cpi%20%5Ctimes%2010%5E%7B-7%7D%20%5C%3B%5Ctext%7BTm/A%7D%20%26%26%5Ctext%7B%5B2%5D%20Permeability%20of%20Vacuum%20%28approximately%20same%20for%20air%20also%29%7D%0A%20"
  alt=
  "B_{\text{wire}} = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 \pi r}&amp;&amp; \text{[1] Magnetic field at a distance } r \text{ from a current-carrying wire}\\ \text{Where } \mu_0=4 \pi \times 10^{-7} \;\text{Tm/A} &amp;&amp;\text{[2] Permeability of Vacuum (approximately same for air also)} ">
  Meanwhile, its direction can be found using the so called
  <strong>first right hand rule</strong>: point your thumb in the
  direction of the current. Then, curl your fingers around the
  wire. The direction your fingers will point in the same direction
  as the field. Be sure to use your right hand!</p>

  <p><img src="/rpc/ck12/images?id=162" alt="" width="200px"></p>

  <p>Sometimes, it is necessary to represent such three dimensional
  fields on a two dimensional sheet of paper. The following example
  illustrates how this is done.</p>

  <p><img src="/rpc/ck12/images?id=163" alt="" width="100px"></p>

  <p>In the example above, a current is running along a wire
  towards the top of your page. The magnetic field is circling the
  wire in loops that are pierced through the center by the current.
  Where these loops intersect this piece of paper, <em>we use the
  symbol <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%5Cbigodot" alt="\bigodot"> to represent
  where the magnetic field is coming</em> <strong><em>out of the
  page</em></strong> <em>and the symbol <img class="x-ck12-math"
  src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%5Cbigotimes" alt="\bigotimes"> to
  represent where the magnetic field is going</em> <strong><em>into
  the page</em></strong><em>.</em> This convention can be used for
  all vector quantities: fields, forces, velocities, etc.</p>

  <h2>Effects of Magnetic Fields</h2>

  <h3>Force on a Charged Particle</h3>

  <p>As moving charges create magnetic fields, so they experience
  forces from magnetic fields generated by other materials. The
  magnitude of the force experienced by a particle traveling in a
  magnetic field depends on the charge of the particle <img class=
  "x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20%28q%29%20" alt=
  " (q) ">, the velocity of the particle <img class="x-ck12-math"
  src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20%28v%29%20" alt=" (v) ">, the
  strength of the field <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%28B%29%20" alt="(B) ">, and, importantly,
  the angle between their relative directions <img class=
  "x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20%28%5Ctheta%29" alt=
  " (\theta)">: <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%20F_B%20%3D%20%20qvB%5Csin%7B%5Ctheta%7D%20%26%26%20%5Ctext%7B%5B3%5D%20Force%20on%20a%20Charged%20Particle%7D"
  alt=
  " F_B = qvB\sin{\theta} &amp;&amp; \text{[3] Force on a Charged Particle}">
  There is a <strong>second right hand rule</strong> that will show
  the direction of the force on a positive charge in a magnetic
  field: point your index finger along the direction of the
  particle&rsquo;s velocity . If your middle finger points along
  the magnetic field, your thumb will point in the direction of the
  force. NOTE: For negative charge reverse the direction of the
  force (or use your left hand)</p>

  <p><img src="/rpc/ck12/images?id=160" alt="" width="200px"></p>

  <p>For instance, if a positively charged particle is moving to
  the right, and it enters a magnetic field pointing towards the
  top of your page, it feels a force going out of the page, while
  if a positively charged particle is moving to the left, and it
  enters a magnetic field pointing towards the top of your page, it
  feels a force going into the page:</p>

  <p><img src="/rpc/ck12/images?id=168" alt="" width="240px"></p>

  <h4>Example 1: Find the Magnetic Field</h4>

  <p><strong>Question</strong>: An electron is moving to the east
  at a speed of <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=1.8%5Ctimes10%5E6%5Cmathrm%7Bm/s%7D" alt=
  "1.8\times10^6\mathrm{m/s}">. It feels a force in the upward
  direction with a magnitude of <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=2.2%3F10%5E%7B-12%7D%5Cmathrm%7BN%7D" alt=
  "2.2?10^{-12}\mathrm{N}">. What is the magnitude and direction of
  the magnetic field this electron just passed through?</p>

  <p><strong>Answer</strong>: There are two parts to this question,
  the magnitude of the electric field and the direction. We will
  first focus on the magnitude.</p>

  <p>To find the magnitude we will use the equation <img class=
  "x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0AF_B%3DqvBsin%5Ctheta%0A" alt=
  "F_B=qvBsin\theta"> We were given the force of the magnetic field
  <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%282.2%3F10%5E%7B-12%7D%5Cmathrm%7BN%7D%29"
  alt="(2.2?10^{-12}\mathrm{N})"> and the velocity that the
  electron is traveling <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%281.8%5Ctimes10%5E6%5Cmathrm%7Bm/s%7D%29"
  alt="(1.8\times10^6\mathrm{m/s})">. We also know the charge of
  the electron <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%281.6%5Ctimes10%5E%7B-19%7D%5Cmathrm%7BC%7D%29"
  alt="(1.6\times10^{-19}\mathrm{C})">. Also, because the
  electron's velocity is perpendicular to the field, we do not have
  to deal with <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%5Csin%5Ctheta" alt="\sin\theta"> because
  <img class="x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%5Csin%5Ctheta"
  alt="\sin\theta"> of <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=90" alt="90"> degrees is <img class=
  "x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=1" alt="1">. Therefore all
  we have to do is solve for B and plug in the known values to get
  the answer. <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0AF_B%3DqvB%5Csin%5Ctheta%0A%5Cintertext%7BSolving%20for%20B%3A%7D%0A%20B%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7BF_B%7D%7Bqv%5Csin%5Ctheta%7D%0A"
  alt=
  "F_B=qvB\sin\theta \intertext{Solving for B:} B = \frac{F_B}{qv\sin\theta}">
  Now, plugging the known values we have <img class=
  "x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0AB%3D%5Cfrac%7BF_B%7D%7Bqv%5Csin%5Ctheta%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7B2.2%3F10%5E%7B-12%7D%5Cmathrm%7BN%7D%7D%7B1.6%5Ctimes10%5E%7B-19%7D%5Cmathrm%7BC%7D%20%5Ctimes%201.8%5Ctimes10%5E6%5Cmathrm%7Bm/s%7D%5Ctimes1%7D%3D7.6%5Cmathrm%7BT%7D%0A"
  alt=
  "B=\frac{F_B}{qv\sin\theta}=\frac{2.2?10^{-12}\mathrm{N}}{1.6\times10^{-19}\mathrm{C} \times 1.8\times10^6\mathrm{m/s}\times1}=7.6\mathrm{T}">
  Now we will find the direction of the field. We know the
  direction of the velocity (east) and the direction of the force
  due to the magnetic field (up, out of the page). Therefore we can
  use the second right hand rule (we will use the left hand, since
  an electron's charge is negative). Point the pointer finger to
  the right to represent the velocity and the thumb up to represent
  the force. This forces the middle finger, which represents the
  direction of the magnetic field, to point south. Alternatively,
  we could recognize that this situation is illustrated for a
  <em>positive</em> particle in the right half of the drawing
  above; for a negative particle to experience the same force, the
  field has to point in the opposite direction: south.</p>

  <h4>Example 2: Circular Motion in Magnetic Fields</h4>

  <p>Consider the following problem: a positively charged particle
  with an initial velocity of <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20%5Cvec%7Bv%7D_1%20" alt=" \vec{v}_1 ">,
  charge <img class="x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20q%20"
  alt=" q "> and mass <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20m%20" alt=" m "> traveling in the plane
  of this page enters a region with a constant magnetic field
  <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20%5Cvec%7BB%7D%20" alt=" \vec{B} ">
  pointing into the page. We are interested in finding the
  trajectory of this particle.</p>

  <p><img src="/rpc/ck12/images?id=166" alt="" width="200px"></p>

  <p>Since the force on a charged particle in a magnetic field is
  always perpendicular to both its velocity vector and the field
  vector (check this using the second right hand rule above), a
  <em>constant</em> magnetic field will provide a centripetal force
  --- that is, a constant force that is always directed
  perpendicular to the direction of motion. Two such force/velocity
  combinations are illustrated above. According to our study of
  rotational motion, this implies that as long as the particle does
  not leave the region of the magnetic field, it will travel in a
  circle. To find the radius of the circle, we set the magnitude of
  the centripetal force equal to the magnitude of the magnetic
  force and solve for <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20r%20" alt=" r ">: <img class=
  "x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0AF_c%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bmv%5E2%7D%7Br%7D%20%3D%20F_B%20%3D%20qvB%5Csin%20%5Ctheta%20%3D%20qvB%0A%5Cintertext%7BTherefore%2C%7D%0Ar%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bmv%5E2%7D%7BqvB%7D%0A"
  alt=
  "F_c = \frac{mv^2}{r} = F_B = qvB\sin \theta = qvB \intertext{Therefore,} r = \frac{mv^2}{qvB}"></p>

  <p>In the examples above, <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20%5Ctheta%20" alt=" \theta "> was
  conveniently 90 degrees, which made <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20%5Csin%20%5Ctheta%20%3D%201" alt=
  " \sin \theta = 1">. But that does not really matter; in a
  constant magnetic fields a different <img class="x-ck12-math"
  src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20%5Ctheta%20" alt=" \theta "> will
  simply decrease the force by a constant factor and will not
  change the qualitative behavior of the particle, since
  <em><img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20%5Ctheta%20" alt=" \theta "> cannot
  change due to such a magnetic force.</em> (Why? Hint: what is the
  force perpendicular to? Read the paragraph above.)</p>

  <h3>Force on a Wire</h3>

  <p>Since a wire is nothing but a collection of moving charges,
  the force it will experience in a magnetic field will simply be
  the vector sum of the forces on the individual charges. If the
  wire is straight --- that is, all the charges are moving in the
  same direction --- these forces will all point in the same
  direction, and so will their sum. Then, the direction of the
  force can be found using the second right hand rule, while its
  magnitude will depend on the length of the wire (denoted
  <img class="x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20L" alt=
  " L">), the strength of the current, the strength of the field,
  and the angle between their directions:</p>

  <p><img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%20F_%7B%5Ctext%7Bwire%7D%7D%3D%20LIB%5Csin%28%5Ctheta%29%20%26%26%5Ctext%7B%5B4%5D%20Force%20on%20a%20Current%20Carrying%20Wire%7D"
  alt=
  " F_{\text{wire}}= LIB\sin(\theta) &amp;&amp;\text{[4] Force on a Current Carrying Wire}"></p>

  <p>Two current-carrying wires next to each other each generate
  magnetic fields and therefore exert forces on each other:</p>

  <p><img src="/rpc/ck12/images?id=159" alt="" width="240px"></p>

  <p>By plugging equation [1] into equation [4], one can find the
  exact formula for this force (left to the reader --- make sure to
  remember that the two wires can have different currents).</p>

  <h3>Electromagnetic Induction</h3>

  <p>Changing magnetic fields passing through a loop of wire
  generate currents in that wire; this is how electric power
  generators work. Likewise, a changing current in a wire will
  create a changing magnetic field; this is how speakers and
  electric motors work.</p>

  <p>To understand induction, we need to introduce the concept of
  <strong>electromagnetic flux</strong>. If you have a closed,
  looped wire of area <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=A" alt="A"> (measured in <img class=
  "x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20%5Cmathrm%7Bm%5E2%7D%20" alt=
  " \mathrm{m^2} ">) and <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=N" alt="N"> loops, and you pass a magnetic
  field <img class="x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=B" alt=
  "B"> through, the magnetic flux <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%5CPhi" alt="\Phi"> is given by the formula
  below. Again, the relative direction of the loops and the field
  matter; this relationship is preserved by creating an 'area
  vector': a vector whose magnitude is equal to the area of the
  loop and whose direction is perpendicular to the plane of the
  loop. The directions' influence can then be conveniently captured
  through a dot product: <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%20%5CPhi%20%3D%20N%20%5Cvec%7BB%7D%20%5Ccdot%20%5Cvec%7BA%7D%20%26%26%5Ctext%7B%5B5%5D%20Electromagnetic%20Flux%7D%20"
  alt=
  " \Phi = N \vec{B} \cdot \vec{A} &amp;&amp;\text{[5] Electromagnetic Flux} ">
  The units of magnetic flux are <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%5Ctext%7BT%7D%20%5Ctimes%20%5Cmathrm%7Bm%5E2%7D"
  alt="\text{T} \times \mathrm{m^2}">, also known as
  <strong>Webers</strong><img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%5Ctext%7B%28Wb%29%7D" alt=
  "\text{(Wb)}">.</p>

  <p><img src="/rpc/ck12/images?id=155" alt="" width="350px"></p>

  <p>In the example above, there are four loops of wire <img class=
  "x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%28N%20%3D%204%29" alt=
  "(N = 4)"> and each has area <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%5Cpi%20r%5E2" alt="\pi r^2"> (horizontally
  hashed). The magnetic field is pointing at an angle <img class=
  "x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20%5Ctheta%20" alt=
  " \theta "> to the area vector. If the magnetic field has
  magnitude <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20B%20" alt=" B ">, the flux through the
  loops will equal <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%204%20%5Ccos%20%5Ctheta%20B%20%5Cpi%20r%5E2"
  alt=" 4 \cos \theta B \pi r^2">. Think of the magnetic flux as
  the part of the &ldquo;bundle&rdquo; of magnetic field lines
  &ldquo;held&rdquo; by the loop that points along the area
  vector.</p>

  <p><em>If the magnetic flux through a loop or loops changes,
  electrons in the wire will feel a force, and this will generate a
  current</em>. The <em>induced voltage</em> (also called
  <strong>electromotive force, or emf</strong>) that they feel is
  equal to the change in flux <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%5Ctriangle%20%5CPhi" alt="\triangle \Phi">
  divided by the amount of time <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%5Ctriangle%20t" alt="\triangle t"> that
  change took. This relationship is called Faraday&rsquo;s Law of
  Induction: <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%20emf%20%3D%20-%5Cfrac%7B%5CDelta%20%5CPhi%7D%7B%5CDelta%20t%7D%26%26%20%5Ctext%7B%5B6%5D%20Faraday%27s%20Law%20of%20Induction%7D%20"
  alt=
  " emf = -\frac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t}&amp;&amp; \text{[6] Faraday's Law of Induction} "></p>

  <p>The direction of the induced current is determined as follows:
  the current will flow so as to generate a magnetic field that
  <em>opposes</em> the change in flux. This is called Lenz&rsquo;s
  Law. Note that the electromotive force described above is not
  actually a force, since it is measured in Volts and acts like an
  induced potential difference. It was originally called that since
  it caused charged particles to move --- hence
  <em>electromotive</em> --- and the name stuck (it's somewhat
  analogous to calling an increase in a particle's gravitational
  potential energy difference a gravitomotive force). For practical
  (Ohm's Law, etc) purposes it can be treated like the voltage from
  a battery.</p>

  <p>Since only a changing flux can produce an induced potential
  difference, one or more of the variables in equation [5] must be
  changing if the ammeter in the picture above is to register any
  current. Specifically, the following can all induce a current in
  the loops of wire:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Changing the direction or magnitude of the magnetic
    field.</li>

    <li>Changing the loops' orientation or area.</li>

    <li>Moving the loops out of the region with the magnetic
    field.</li>
  </ul>
