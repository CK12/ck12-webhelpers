  <h2>The Big Idea</h2>

  <p><em>Conservation of charge</em> is the fourth of the five
  conservation laws in physics. There are two types of charge:
  positive and negative; the law of conservation of electric charge
  states that the net charge of the universe remains constant. As
  with momentum and energy, in any closed system charge can be
  transferred from one body to another and can move within the
  system but cannot leave the system.</p>

  <p><strong>Electromagnetism</strong> is associated with charge
  and is a fundamental force of nature, like gravity (which for us
  is associated with mass). If charges are static, the only
  manifestation of electromagnetism is the <em>Coulomb electric
  force.</em> In the same way the gravitational force that an
  object exerts upon other objects, and that other objects exert on
  it, depends on the amount of mass it possesses, <strong><em>the
  Coulomb electric force</em></strong> <em>that an object
  experiences depends on the amount of</em> <strong><em>electric
  charge</em></strong> the object possesses. Like gravity, the
  Coulomb electric force decreases with the square of the distance.
  The Coulomb electric force is responsible for many of the forces
  we discussed previously: the normal force, contact forces such as
  friction, and so on --- <em>all</em> of these forces arise in the
  mutual attraction and repulsion of charged particles.</p>

  <p>Although the law determining the magnitude of the Coulomb
  electric force has the same form as the law of gravity, the
  electric constant is 20 orders of magnitude greater than the
  gravitational constant. That is why electricity normally
  dominates gravity at the atomic and molecular level. Since there
  is only one type of mass but two opposite types of electric
  charge, gravity will dominate in large bodies <em>unless there is
  a separation of charge.</em></p>

  <h2>Electric Forces and Fields</h2>

  <h2>The Coulomb Force Law</h2>

  <p>The Coulomb Force Law states that any two charged particles
  <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20%28q_1%2Cq_2%29%20" alt=" (q_1,q_2) ">
  --- with charge measured in units of Coulombs --- at a distance
  <img class="x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20r%20" alt=
  " r "> from each other will experience a force of repulsion or
  attraction along the line joining them equal to: <img class=
  "x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0A%5Cvec%7BF_e%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bkq_1q_2%7D%7Br%5E2%7D%26%26%20%5Ctext%7BThe%20Coulomb%20Force%20%5B1%5D%7D%0A%5Cintertext%7BWhere%7D%0Ak%20%3D%208.987%20%5Ctimes%2010%5E9%20%5C%20%5Cmathrm%7BN%20%20%5Ccdot%20m%5E2%20%5Ccdot%20C%5E%7B-2%7D%7D.%20%26%26%5Ctext%7BThe%20Electric%20Constant%7D%0A"
  alt=
  "\vec{F_e} = \frac{kq_1q_2}{r^2}&amp;&amp; \text{The Coulomb Force [1]} \intertext{Where} k = 8.987 \times 10^9 \ \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 \cdot C^{-2}}. &amp;&amp;\text{The Electric Constant}">
  This looks a lot like the Law of Universal Gravitation, which
  deals with attraction between objects with mass. The big
  difference is that while any two masses experience mutual
  <em>attraction</em>, two charges can either attract or repel each
  other, depending on whether the signs of their charges are
  alike:</p>

  <p><img src="/rpc/ck12/images?id=116" alt="" width="300px"></p>

  <p>Like gravitational (and all other) forces, Coulomb forces add
  as vectors. Thus to find the force on a charge from an
  arrangement of charges, one needs to find the vector sum of the
  force from each charge in the arrangement.</p>

  <h3>Example 1</h3>

  <p><strong>Question</strong>: Two negatively charged spheres (one
  with <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=-12%5Cmu%5Cmathrm%7BC%7D" alt=
  "-12\mu\mathrm{C}">; the other with <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=-3%5Cmu%5Cmathrm%7BC%7D" alt=
  "-3\mu\mathrm{C}">) are <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=3%5Cmathrm%7Bm%7D" alt="3\mathrm{m}"> apart.
  Where could you place an electron so that it will be suspended in
  space between them with a net force of zero (for this problem we
  will ignore the force of repulsion between the two charges
  because they are held in place)?</p>

  <p><img src="/rpc/ck12/images?id=127" alt="" width="300px"></p>

  <p><strong>Answer</strong>: Consider the diagram above; here
  <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20r_%7Bs%5Crightarrow%20e%7D%20" alt=
  " r_{s\rightarrow e} "> is the distance between the electron and
  the small charge, while <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%5Cvec%7BF%7D_%7Bs%5Crightarrow%20e%7D%20"
  alt="\vec{F}_{s\rightarrow e} "> is the force the electron feels
  due to it. For the electron to be balanced in between the two
  charges, the forces of repulsion caused by the two charges on the
  electron would have to be balanced. To do this, we will set the
  equation for the force exerted by two charges on each other equal
  and solve for a distance ratio. We will denote the difference
  between the charges through the subscripts "s" for the smaller
  charge, "e" for the electron, and "l" for the larger charge.
  <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0A%5Cfrac%7Bkq_sq_e%7D%7Br_%7Bs%5Crightarrow%20e%7D%5E2%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7Bkq_lq_e%7D%7Br_%7Be%5Crightarrow%20l%7D%5E2%7D%0A"
  alt=
  "\frac{kq_sq_e}{r_{s\rightarrow e}^2}=\frac{kq_lq_e}{r_{e\rightarrow l}^2}"></p>

  <p>Now we can cancel. The charge of the electron cancels. The
  constant <img class="x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=k"
  alt="k"> also cancels. We can then replace the large and small
  charges with the numbers. This leaves us with the distances. We
  can then manipulate the equation to produce a ratio of the
  distances. <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0A%5Cfrac%7B-3%5Cmu%5Cmathrm%7BC%7D%7D%7Br_%7Bs%5Crightarrow%20e%7D%5E2%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7B-3%5Cmu%5Cmathrm%7BC%7D%7D%7Br_%7Be%5Crightarrow%20l%7D%5E2%7D%20%5CRightarrow%20%5Cfrac%7Br_%7Bs%5Crightarrow%20e%7D%5E2%7D%7Br_%7Be%5Crightarrow%20l%7D%5E2%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7B-12%5Cmu%5Cmathrm%7BC%7D%7D%7B-12%5Cmu%5Cmathrm%7BC%7D%7D%20%5CRightarrow%20%0A%5Cfrac%7Br_%7Bs%5Crightarrow%20e%7D%7D%7Br_%7Be%5Crightarrow%20l%7D%7D%3D%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%5Cmu%5Cmathrm%7BC%7D%7D%7B4%5Cmu%5Cmathrm%7BC%7D%7D%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%0A"
  alt=
  "\frac{-3\mu\mathrm{C}}{r_{s\rightarrow e}^2}=\frac{-3\mu\mathrm{C}}{r_{e\rightarrow l}^2} \Rightarrow \frac{r_{s\rightarrow e}^2}{r_{e\rightarrow l}^2}=\frac{-12\mu\mathrm{C}}{-12\mu\mathrm{C}} \Rightarrow \frac{r_{s\rightarrow e}}{r_{e\rightarrow l}}=\sqrt{\frac{1\mu\mathrm{C}}{4\mu\mathrm{C}}}=\frac{1}{2}"></p>

  <p>Given this ratio, we know that the electron is twice as far
  from the large charge (<img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=-12%5Cmu%5Cmathrm%7BC%7D" alt=
  "-12\mu\mathrm{C}">) as from the small charge (<img class=
  "x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=-12%5Cmu%5Cmathrm%7BC%7D"
  alt="-12\mu\mathrm{C}">). Given that the distance between the
  small and large charges is <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=3%5Cmathrm%7Bm%7D" alt="3\mathrm{m}">, we
  can determine that the electron must be located <img class=
  "x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=2%5Cmathrm%7Bm%7D" alt=
  "2\mathrm{m}"> away from the large charge and <img class=
  "x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=1%5Cmathrm%7Bm%7D" alt=
  "1\mathrm{m}"> away from the smaller charge.</p>

  <h3>Electric Fields and Electric Forces</h3>

  <p>Gravity and the Coulomb force have a nice property in common:
  they can be represented by <strong>fields</strong>. Fields are a
  kind of bookkeeping tool used to keep track of forces. Take the
  electromagnetic force between two charges given above:
  <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%5Cvec%7BF_e%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bkq_1q_2%7D%7Br%5E2%7D"
  alt="\vec{F_e} = \frac{kq_1q_2}{r^2}"> If we are interested in
  the acceleration of the first charge only --- due to the force
  from the second charge --- we can rewrite this force as the
  product of <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%7Bq_1%7D%20" alt="{q_1} "> and <img class=
  "x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%5Cfrac%7Bkq_2%7D%7Br%5E2%7D" alt=
  "\frac{kq_2}{r^2}">. The first part of this product only depends
  on properties of the object we're interested in (the first
  charge), and the second part can be thought of as a property of
  the point in space where that object is.</p>

  <p>In fact, the quantity <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%5Cfrac%7Bkq_2%7D%7Br%5E2%7D" alt=
  "\frac{kq_2}{r^2}"> captures everything about the electromagnetic
  force on any object possible at a distance <strong>r</strong>
  from <img class="x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20q_2%20"
  alt=" q_2 ">. If we had replaced <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20q_1%20" alt=" q_1 "> with a different
  charge, <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20q_3%20" alt=" q_3 ">, we would simply
  multiply <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20q_3%20" alt=" q_3 "> by <img class=
  "x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%5Cfrac%7Bkq_2%7D%7Br%5E2%7D" alt=
  "\frac{kq_2}{r^2}"> to find the new force on the new charge. Such
  a quantity, <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%5Cfrac%7Bkq_2%7D%7Br%5E2%7D" alt=
  "\frac{kq_2}{r^2}"> here, is referred to as the electric field
  from charge <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20q_2%20" alt=" q_2 "> at that point: in
  this case, it is the electric field due to a single charge:
  <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0A%5Cvec%7BE_f%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bkq%7D%7Br%5E2%7D%20%26%26%5Ctext%7B%5B2%5D%20Electric%20field%20due%20to%20point%20charge%20%7D%20q%20%2C%5Ctext%7B%20distance%20%7D%20r%20%5Ctext%7B%20away%7D%20%0A"
  alt=
  "\vec{E_f} = \frac{kq}{r^2} &amp;&amp;\text{[2] Electric field due to point charge } q ,\text{ distance } r \text{ away} "></p>

  <p>The electric field is a vector quantity, and points in the
  direction that a force felt by a positive charge at that point
  would. If we are given the electric field at some point, it is
  just a matter of multiplication --- as illustrated above --- to
  find the force any charge <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20q_0%20" alt=" q_0 "> would feel at that
  point: <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0A%5Cunderbrace%7B%5Cvec%7BF_e%7D%7D_%7B%5Ctext%7BForce%20on%20charge%20%7Dq_0%7D%20%3D%20%5Cunderbrace%7B%5Cvec%7BE_f%7D%7D_%7B%5Ctext%7BField%7D%7D%20%5Cunderbrace%7B%5Ctimes%20q_0%7D_%7B%5Ctext%7BCharge%7D%7D%20%26%26%5Ctext%7BForce%20on%20charge%20%7Dq_0%5Ctext%7B%20in%20an%20electric%20field%7D%0A"
  alt=
  "\underbrace{\vec{F_e}}_{\text{Force on charge }q_0} = \underbrace{\vec{E_f}}_{\text{Field}} \underbrace{\times q_0}_{\text{Charge}} &amp;&amp;\text{Force on charge }q_0\text{ in an electric field}">
  Note that this is true for <em>all</em> electric fields, not just
  those from point charges. In general, the <strong>electric
  field</strong> at a point <em>is the force a</em>
  <strong><em>positive test charge of magnitude 1</em></strong>
  <em>would feel at that point</em>. Any other charge will feel a
  force along the same line (but possibly in the other direction)
  in proportion to its magnitude. In other words, the electric
  field can be though of as "force per unit charge".</p>

  <p>In the case given above, the field was due to a single charge.
  Such a field is shown in the figure below. Notice that this a
  field due to a positive charge, since the field arrows are
  pointing outward. The field produced by a point charge will be
  radially symmetric i.e., the strength of the field only depends
  on the distance, <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20r%20" alt=" r ">, from the charge, not
  the direction; the lengths of the arrows represent the strength
  of the field.</p>

  <h3>Example 2</h3>

  <p><strong>Question</strong>: Calculate the electric field a
  distance of <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=4.0%5Cmathrm%7Bmm%7D" alt="4.0\mathrm{mm}">
  away from a <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=-2.0%5Cmu%20%5Cmathrm%7BC%7D" alt=
  "-2.0\mu \mathrm{C}"> charge. Then, calculate the force on a

  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=-8.0%5Cmu%20%5Cmathrm%7BC%7D" alt=
  "-8.0\mu \mathrm{C}"> charge placed at this point.</p>

  <p><strong>Answer</strong>: To calculate the electric field we
  will use the equation <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0AE%3D%5Cfrac%7Bkq%7D%7Br%5E2%7D%0A"
  alt="E=\frac{kq}{r^2}"> Before we solve for the electric field by
  plugging in the values, we convert all of the values to the same
  units. <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0A4.0%5Cmathrm%7Bmm%7D%5Ctimes%20%5Cfrac%7B1%5Cmathrm%7Bm%7D%7D%7B1000%5Cmathrm%7Bmm%7D%7D%3D.004%5Cmathrm%7Bm%7D%5C%5C%0A-2.0%5Cmu%20%5Cmathrm%7BC%7D%5Ctimes%20%5Cfrac%7B1%5Cmathrm%7BC%7D%7D%7B1000000%5Cmu%20%5Cmathrm%7BC%7D%7D%3D-2.0%5Ctimes%2010%5E%7B-6%7D%5Cmathrm%7BC%7D%0A"
  alt=

  Now that we have consistent units we can solve the problem.
  <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=

  To solve for the force at the point we will use the equation

  <h2>Fields Due to Several Charges</h2>

  <p>To find the field at a point due to an arrangement of charges
  --- in fact, all electric fields arise due to <em>some</em>
  arrangement of charges --- we find the vector sum of the
  individual fields: <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0A%5Cvec%7BE_%7Bnet%7D%7D%20%3D%20%5Csum_i%20%7B%5Cvec%7BE_i%7D%7D%20%26%26%5Ctext%7B%5B3%5D%20Net%20Electric%20Field%7D%0A"
  alt=
  "\vec{E_{net}} = \sum_i {\vec{E_i}} &amp;&amp;\text{[3] Net Electric Field}">
  Electric fields are used more frequently than gravitational ones
  because there are two types of charge, which makes electric force
  and potential energy harder to keep track of than their
  gravitational counterparts. To apply this approach to
  gravitational forces --- that is, to find a net gravitational
  field --- one needs to repeat the steps above, with mass in place
  of charge (left for the reader).</p>

  <h3>Example 3</h3>

  <p><img src="/rpc/ck12/images?id=133" alt="" width="300px"></p>

  <p><strong>Question</strong>: For the diagram above, draw
  (qualitatively) the electric field vectors at the points shown
  using the test charge method.</p>

  <p><strong>Answer</strong>: We will start with Test Charge 1.
  Test charges are always positive and have magnitude 1. Therefore
  we know that the test charge will want to go toward the negative
  charge and away from the positive charge (like charges repel and
  opposite charges attract). The strength of the electric field
  felt by the test charge is dependent on the inverse square of the
  distance of the charges as shown by the equation <img class=
  "x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0AE%3D%5Cfrac%7Bkq%7D%7Br%5E2%7D%0A"
  alt="E=\frac{kq}{r^2}"> The farther away from the source of the
  field, the weaker the field becomes. Therefore Test Charge 1 will
  experience a stronger field from the 1C charge. Because the
  distance from Test Charge 1 to the <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=-1%5Cmathrm%7BC%7D" alt="-1\mathrm{C}"> is
  only slightly longer than the distance from Test Charge 1 to the
  1C charge, the vectors will be similar in length. Once we have
  determined the relative scale of each vector, we can add them
  using the parallelogram method. The resultant vector is the
  electric field at that point.</p>

  <p>Finding the electric field at Test Charge 2 will involve all
  of the same steps. First we must determine which charge Test
  Charge 2 is closer to. Like Test Charge 1, Test Charge 2 is
  closer to the 1C charge. However, Test Charge 2 is drastically
  closer whereas Test Charge 1 was only slightly closer. Therefore,
  the electric field that Test Charge 2 experiences as a result of
  the 1C charge will be strong, thus resulting in a longer arrow.
  The distance between the <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=-1C" alt="-1C"> and Test Charge 2 is large
  and therefore the electric field experienced by Test Charge 2 as
  a result of the <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=-1C" alt="-1C"> charge will be small. The
  resultant vectors will look something like this.</p>

  <p><img src="/rpc/ck12/images?id=132" alt="" width="300px"></p>

  <h2>Electric Potential</h2>

  <p>Like gravity, the electric force can do work and has a
  potential energy associated with it. But like we use fields to
  keep track of electromagnetic forces, we use <strong>electric
  potential</strong>, or <strong>voltage</strong> to keep track of
  electric potential energy. So instead of looking for the
  potential energy of specific objects, we define it in terms of
  properties of the space where the objects are.</p>

  <p>The <strong><em>electric potential
  difference</em></strong><em>, or</em> <strong><em>voltage
  difference</em></strong> <em>(often just called voltage) between
  two points (A and B) in the presence of an electric field is
  defined as the work it would take to move a</em>
  <strong><em>positive test charge of magnitude 1</em></strong>
  <em>from the first point to the second against the electric force
  provided by the field</em>. For any other charge <img class=
  "x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20q%20" alt=" q ">, then,

  The energy that the object gains or loses when traveling through
  a potential difference is supplied (or absorbed) by the electric
  field --- there is nothing else there. Therefore, it follows that
  <em>electric fields contain energy</em>.</p>

  <p>To summarize: just as an electric field denotes force per unit
  charge, so electric potential differences represent potential
  energy differences <em>per unit charge</em>. A useful mnemonic is
  to consider a cell phone: the battery has the potential to do
  work for you, but it needs a charge! Actually, the analogy there
  is much more rigorous than it at first seems; we'll see why in
  the chapter on current. Since voltage is a quantity proportional
  to work it is a scalar, and can be positive or negative.</p>

  <h2>Electric Field of a Parallel Plate Capacitor</h2>

  <p>Suppose we have two parallel metal plates set a distance
  <img class="x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=d" alt="d">
  from one another. We place a positive charge on one of the plates
  and a negative charge on the other. In this configuration, there
  will be a uniform electric field between the plates pointing
  from, and normal to, the plate carrying the positive charge. The
  magnitude of this field is given by <img class=
  "x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0AE%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7BV%7D%7Bd%7D%0A"
  alt="E = \frac{V}{d}"> where V is the potential difference
  (voltage) between the two plates.</p>

  <p>The amount of charge, <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=Q" alt="Q">, held by each plate is given by
  <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0AQ%20%3D%20CV%0A" alt="Q = CV"> where
  again <img class="x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=V" alt=
  "V"> is the voltage difference between the plates and <img class=
  "x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=C" alt="C"> is the
  capacitance of the plate configuration. Capacitance can be
  thought of as the capacity a device has for storing charge . In
  the parallel plate case the capacitance is given by <img class=
  "x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0AC%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cepsilon_0%20A%7D%7Bd%7D%0A"
  alt="C = \frac{\epsilon_0 A}{d}"> where <img class="x-ck12-math"
  src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=A" alt="A"> is the area of the plates,
  <img class="x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20d%20" alt=
  " d "> is the distance between the plates, and <img class=
  "x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20%5Cepsilon_0%20" alt=
  " \epsilon_0 "> is the permittivity of free space whose value is
  <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%208.84%20%5Ctimes%2010%5E%7B-12%7D%20C/V%20%5Ccdot%20m%20"
  alt=" 8.84 \times 10^{-12} C/V \cdot m ">.</p>

  <p>The electric field between the capacitor plates stores energy.
  The electric potential energy, <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=U_%7B%5Ctext%7BC%7D%7D%20" alt=
  "U_{\text{C}} ">, stored in the capacitor is given by</p>

  <p><img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0AU_%7B%5Ctext%7BC%7D%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7DCV%5E2%0A"
  alt="U_{\text{C}} = \frac{1}{2}CV^2"></p>

  <p>Where does this energy come from? Recall, that in our
  preliminary discussion of electric forces we assert that "like
  charges repel one another". To build our initial configuration we
  had to place an excess of positive and negative charges,
  respectively, on each of the metal plates. Forcing these charges
  together on the plate had to overcome the mutual repulsion that
  the charges experience; this takes work. The energy used in
  moving the charges onto the plates gets stored in the field
  between the plates. It is in this way that the capacitor can be
  thought of as an energy storage device. This property will become
  more important when we study capacitors in the context of
  electric circuits in the next chapter.</p>

  <p>Note: Many home-electronic circuits include capacitors; for
  this reason, it can be dangerous to mess around with old
  electronic components, as the capacitors may be charged even if
  the unit is unplugged. For example, old computer monitors (not
  flat screens) and TVs have capacitors that hold dangerous amounts
  of charge hours after the power is turned off.</p>

  <h3>More on Electric and Gravitational Potential</h3>

  <p>There are several differences between our approach to gravity
  and electricity that could cause confusion. First, with gravity
  we usually used the concept of "energy", rather than "energy
  difference". Second, we spoke about it in absolute terms, rather
  than "per unit mass".</p>

  <p>To address the first issue: when we dealt with gravitational
  potential energy we had to set some reference height <img class=
  "x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20h%20%3D%200%20" alt=
  " h = 0 "> where it is equal to <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20mg%20%5Ctimes%200%20%3D%200%20" alt=
  " mg \times 0 = 0 ">. In this sense, we were really talking about
  potential energy differences rather than absolute levels then
  also: at any point, we compared the gravitational potential
  energy of an object to the energy it would have had at the
  reference level <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20h%20%3D%200%20" alt=" h = 0 ">. When we
  used the formula <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0AU_g%20%3D%20mg%5CDelta%20h%0A" alt=
  "U_g = mg\Delta h"> we implicitly set the initial point as the
  zero: no free lunch! For the same reason, we use the concept of
  electric potential difference between two points --- or we need
  to set the potential at some point to 0, and use it as a
  reference. This is not as easy in this case though; usually a
  point very far away ("infinitely" far) is considered to have 0
  electric potential.</p>

  <p>Regarding the second issue: in the chapter on potential
  energy, we could have gravitational potential difference between
  two points at different heights as <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20g%5CDelta%20h%20" alt=" g\Delta h ">.
  This, of course, is the work required to move an object of mass
  one a height <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20%5CDelta%20h%20" alt=" \Delta h ">
  against gravity. To find the work required for any other mass, we
  would multiply this by its magnitude. In other words, <img class=
  "x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0A%5Cunderbrace%7BW%7D_%7B%5Ctext%7BWork%7D%7D%20%3D%5Cunderbrace%7Bm%7D_%7B%5Ctext%7BMass%7D%7D%20%5Ctimes%20%5Cunderbrace%7Bg%5CDelta%20h%7D_%7B%5Ctext%7BPotential%20Difference%7D%7D%20%20%0A"
  alt=
  "\underbrace{W}_{\text{Work}} =\underbrace{m}_{\text{Mass}} \times \underbrace{g\Delta h}_{\text{Potential Difference}} ">
  Which is exactly analogous to the equation above.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>An advanced note: for a certain class of forces called
    <em>conservative</em> forces e.g., gravity and the
    electromagnetic force, a specific potential distribution
    corresponds to a unique field. Conversely, a field corresponds
    to a unique potential distribution up to an additive constant.
    Remember though, it's relative potential between points not
    absolute potential that is physically relevant. In effect the
    field corresponds to a unique potential. In particular, we see
    that in the case of conservative forces the scalar potential
    (one degree of freedom per point) carries all information
    needed to determine the vector electric field (three degrees of
    freedom per point. The potential formulation is even more
    useful than it at first seems.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Key Concepts</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Electrons have negative charge and protons have positive
    charge. The magnitude of the charge is the same for both:
    <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
    "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20e%3D%201.6%20%5Ctimes%2010%5E%7B-19%7D%20%5Ctext%7BC%7D"
    alt=" e= 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{C}">.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>In any closed system, electric charge is conserved. The
    total electric charge of the universe does not change.
    Therefore, electric charge can only be transferred not lost
    from one body to another.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Normally, electric charge is transferred when electrons
    leave the outer orbits of the atoms of one body (leaving it
    positively charged) and move to the surface of another body
    (causing the new surface to gain a negative net charge). <em>In
    a</em> <strong><em>plasma</em></strong><em>, the fourth state
    of matter, all electrons are stripped from the atoms, leaving
    positively charged ions and free electrons</em>.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Similarly-charged objects have a repulsive force between
    them. Oppositely charged objects have an attractive force
    between them.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>The value of the electric field tells you the force that a
    charged object would feel <em>if</em> it entered this field.
    Electric field lines tell you the direction a positive charge
    would go if it were placed in the field.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Electric potential is measured in units of Volts (V) thus
    electric potential is often referred to as voltage. Electric
    potential is the source of the electric potential energy.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Positive charges move towards lower electric potential;
    negative charges move toward higher electric potential. If you
    are familiar with a contour map then positive charges go
    'downhill' and negative charges go 'uphill'.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Key Applications</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>In problems that ask for excess negative or positive
    charge, remember that each electron has one unit of the
    fundamental charge <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
    "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20e%20%3D%201.6%20%5Ctimes%2010%5E%7B-19%7D%20%5Ctext%7BC%7D"
    alt=" e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{C}">.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>To find the speed of a particle after it traverses a
    voltage difference, use the equation for the conservation of
    energy: <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
    "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20q%20%5CDelta%20V%20%3D%20%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20m%20v%5E2%20"
    alt=" q \Delta V = \tfrac{1}{2} m v^2 "></li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Force and electric field are vectors. Use your vector math
    skills (i.e. keep the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> directions
    separate) when solving two-dimensional problems.</li>
  </ul>
