  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>You know that humans deprived of oxygen for more than a few
  minutes will quickly become unconscious and die. Breathing, also
  known as respiration, is essential for human life, because the
  body cannot store oxygen for later use as it does food. The
  mammalian respiratory system, shown in <strong role=
  "strong">Figure</strong> 1.1 <a href="#BIO_5.1.1-fig" id=
  "BIO_5.1.1-text" name="BIO_5.1.1-text">below</a> features a
  diaphragm, trachea, and a thin membrane whose surface area is
  equivalent to the size of a handball court - all for efficient
  oxygen intake. Other forms of life employ different types of
  respiratory organs: fish and aquatic amphibians and insects
  flaunt gills, spiders and scorpions develop "book lungs," and
  terrestrial insects use an elaborate network of tubes called
  tracheae, which open via spiracles, as shown in <strong role=
  "strong">Figure</strong> 1.2 <a href="#Bio_spiracles-fig" id=

  <strong role="strong">Figure</strong> 1.3 <a href=
  "#Bio51-03a-fig" id="Bio51-03a-text" name=
  "Bio51-03a-text">below</a>. A constant supply of oxygen gas is
  clearly important to life. However, do you know why you need
  oxygen?</p>

    <p>Many people would answer that oxygen is needed to make
    carbon dioxide, the gas exhaled or released by each of the
    respiratory systems listed above. However, CO<sub>2</sub> is
    waste product. Surely, there is more to the story than just gas
    exchange with the environment! To begin to appreciate the role
    of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing
    rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or
    skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates
    with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between
    oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical
    reactions inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce
    usable energy are known as <strong role="strong">cellular
    respiration</strong>. This chapter will introduce you to the
    overall process of cellular respiration, and then focus on the
    first stage, which by itself does not require oxygen.</p>

    <h3>An Overview of Cellular Respiration</h3>

    <p>Another way to think about the role of oxygen in your body -
    and a good starting point for understanding the whole process
    of cellular respiration - is to recall the last time you sat by
    a campfire (see below figure) and noticed that it was "dying."
    Often people will blow on a campfire to keep it from "dying
    out." How does blowing help? What happens in a campfire?</p>

    <div style=
    "float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class=
    "figure">
      <div><img src=
      "/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2606" width=
      "256px"></div>

      <p><a href="#Bio51-04a-text" id="Bio51-04a-fig" name=
      "Bio51-04a-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p>

      <p><strong>Figure</strong> 1.4</p>
    </div>

    <p>You know that a fire produces light and heat energy.
    However, it cannot "create" energy (remember that energy cannot
    be created or destroyed). Fire merely transforms the energy
    stored in its fuel &ndash; chemical energy &ndash; into light
    and heat. Another way to describe this energy transformation is
    to say that burning releases the energy stored in fuel. As
    energy is transformed, so are the compounds that make up the
    fuel. In other words, burning is a chemical reaction. We could
    write our understanding of this energy-releasing chemical
    reaction up to this point as:</p>

    <div><img src=
    "/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2596" width=
    "256px"></div>

    <p>Now return to what happens when you blow on a fire. The fire
    was "dying out," so you blew on it to get it going again. Was
    it movement or something in the air that promoted the chemical
    reaction? If you have ever "smothered" a fire, you know that a
    fire needs something in the air to keep burning. That something
    turns out to be oxygen. Oxygen gas is a reactant in the burning
    process. At this point, our equation is:</p>

    <div><img src=
    "/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2609" width=
    "256px"></div>

    <p>To complete this equation, we need to know what happens to
    matter, to the atoms of oxygen, and to the atoms of the fuel
    during the burning. If you collect the gas rising above a piece
    of burning wood in an inverted test tube, you will notice
    condensation - droplets appearing on the sides of the tube.
    Cobalt chloride paper will change from blue to pink, confirming
    that these droplets are water. If you add bromothymol blue
    (BTB) to a second tube of collected gases, the blue solution
    will change to green or yellow (<strong role=
    "strong">Figure</strong> 1.5 <a href="#Bio51-05a-fig" id=
    "Bio51-05a-text" name="Bio51-05a-text">below</a>), indicating
    the presence of carbon dioxide. Thus, carbon dioxide and water
    are products of burning wood.</p>

    <div style=
    "float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class=
    "figure">
      <div><img src=
      "/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2619" width=
      "256px"></div>

      <p><strong>Figure</strong> 1.5</p>
    </div>

    <div><img src=
    "/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2611" width=
    "256px"></div>

    <p>Now we know what happened to those oxygen atoms during the
    chemical reaction, but we need to be sure to identify the
    sources of the carbon atoms in the CO<sub>2</sub> and of the
    hydrogen atoms in the water. If you guessed that these atoms
    make up the wood fuel &ndash; and nearly all fuels we burn,
    from coal to propane to candle wax to gasoline (hydrocarbons!),
    you have solved the equation completely. Overall, burning is
    the combining of oxygen with hydrogen and carbon atoms in a
    fuel (combustion or oxidation) to release the stored chemical
    energy as heat and light. Products of combustion are
    CO<sub>2</sub> (oxidized carbon) and H<sub>2</sub>O (oxidized
    hydrogen). Or in symbols,</p>

    <div><img src=
    "/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2598" width=
    "256px"></div>

    <p>Return to the fate of the oxygen gas you breathe in and
    absorb. Recall that we related breathing rate and oxygen intake
    to energy use. Burning consumes oxygen as it releases stored
    chemical energy, transforming it into light and heat. Cellular
    respiration is actually a slow burn. Your cells absorb the
    oxygen carried by your blood from your lungs, and use the
    O<sub>2</sub> to release stored chemical energy so that you can
    use it.</p>

    <p>However, releasing energy within cells does not produce
    light or intense heat. Cells run on chemical energy &ndash;
    specifically, the small amount temporarily stored in adenine
    triphosphate (ATP) molecules. Cellular respiration transfers
    chemical energy from a "deliverable" fuel molecule &ndash;
    <strong role="strong">glucose</strong> &ndash; to many "usable"
    molecules of <strong role="strong">ATP</strong>. Like oxygen,
    glucose is delivered by your blood to your cells. If ATP were
    delivered to cells, more than
    60,221,417,930,000,000,000,000,000 of these large molecules
    (which contain relatively small amounts of energy) would clog
    your capillaries each day. Pumping them across cell membranes
    would "cost" a great deal of energy. A molecule of glucose
    contains a larger amount of chemical energy in a smaller
    package. Therefore, glucose is much more convenient for
    bloodstream delivery, but too "powerful" to work within the
    cell. The process of cellular respiration uses oxygen to help
    transfer the chemical energy from glucose to ATP, which can be
    used to do work in the cell. This chemical equation expresses
    what we have worked out:</p>

    <div><img src=
    "/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2607" width=
    "256px"></div>

    <p>As with burning, we must trace what happens to atoms during
    cellular respiration. You can readily see that when the carbon
    atoms in glucose are combined with oxygen, they again form
    carbon dioxide. And when the hydrogen atoms in glucose are
    oxidized, they form water, as in burning. You can detect these
    products of cellular respiration in your breath on a cold day
    (as water condensation) and in the lab (BTB turns yellow when
    you blow into it through a straw). The equation:</p>

    <div><img src=
    "/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2589" width=
    "256px"></div>

    <p>This accounts for the energy transfer and the carbon,
    hydrogen, and oxygen atoms, but it does not show the "raw
    materials" or reactants which build ATP. Recall that the energy
    temporarily stored in ATP is released for use when the bond
    between the second and third phosphates is broken. The
    resulting ADP can be recycled within the cell by recombining it
    with inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>).</p>

    <div><img src=
    "/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2594" width=
    "256px"></div>

    <p>Now you should be able to see that the source of energy for
    re-attaching the phosphate is the chemical energy in glucose!
    Materials cycle and recycle, but energy gets used up and must
    be replaced. That is the key to understanding cellular
    respiration: it is a "recharging of the batteries" - ATP
    molecules &ndash; which power cellular work. How many ATP can
    be made by harnessing the energy in a single glucose molecule?
    Although this number varies under certain conditions, most
    cells can capture enough energy from one molecule of glucose to
    build 38 molecules of ATP. Our equation becomes:</p>

    <div><img src=
    "/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2588" width=
    "256px"></div>

    <p>This equation for cellular respiration is not quite
    complete, however, because we can easily mix air and glucose
    sugar (even adding ADP and P<sub>i</sub>) and nothing will
    happen. For the campfire, we indicated above the arrow that a
    necessary condition was a spark or match to start the reaction.
    A spark or match would damage or destroy living tissue. What
    necessary condition initiates the slow burn that is cellular
    respiration? Recall that enzymes are highly specific proteins
    which "speed up" chemical reactions in living cells. More than
    20 kinds of enzymes carry out cellular respiration! If you also
    recall that membranes within organelles often sequence enzymes
    for efficiency, as in chloroplasts for photosynthesis, you will
    not be surprised that a specific organelle, the <strong role=
    "strong">mitochondrion</strong> (<strong role=
    "strong">Figure</strong> 1.6 <a href="#BioI-05-01-07-fig" id=
    "BioI-05-01-07-text" name="BioI-05-01-07-text">below</a>), is
    also a necessary condition of cellular respiration - at least
    in eukaryotes.</p>

    <div style=
    "float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class=
    "figure">
      <div><img src=
      "/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2595" width=
      "256px"></div>

      <p><a href="#BioI-05-01-07-text" id="BioI-05-01-07-fig" name=
      "BioI-05-01-07-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p>

      <p><strong>Figure</strong> 1.6</p>
    </div>

    <p>Within each eukaryotic cell, the membranes of 1000-2000
    mitochondria sequence enzymes and electron carriers and
    compartmentalize ions so that cellular respiration proceeds
    efficiently. Mitochondria, like chloroplasts, contain their own
    DNA and ribosomes and resemble certain bacteria. The
    endosymbiotic theory holds that mitochondria, too, were once
    independently living prokaryotes. Larger prokaryotes engulfed
    (or enslaved) these smaller aerobic cells, forming eukaryotic
    cells. Many prokaryotes today can perform cellular respiration;
    perhaps they and mitochondria have common ancestors. Their
    expertise in generating ATP made mitochondria highly valued
    symbionts.</p>

    <p>Including these necessary conditions and balancing numbers
    of atoms on both sides of the arrow, our final equation for the
    overall process of cellular respiration is:</p>

    <div><img src=
    "/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2628" width=
    "256px"></div>

    <p>In words, cellular respiration uses oxygen gas to break
    apart the carbon-hydrogen bonds in glucose and release their
    energy to build 38 molecules of ATP. Most of this process
    occurs within the mitochondria of the cell. Carbon dioxide and
    water are waste products. This is similar to burning, in which
    oxygen breaks the carbon-hydrogen bonds in a fuel and releases
    their chemical energy as heat and light. Again, carbon dioxide
    and water are waste.</p>

    <p>If you have studied the process of photosynthesis,
    you&rsquo;ve probably already noticed its similarity to the
    process of cellular respiration. Both are processes within the
    cell which make chemical energy available for life.
    Photosynthesis transforms light energy into chemical energy
    stored in glucose, and cellular respiration releases the energy
    from glucose to build ATP, which does the work of life.
    Moreover, photosynthesis reactants CO<sub>2</sub> and
    H<sub>2</sub>O are products of cellular respiration. And the
    reactants of respiration,
    C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>, are
    the products of photosynthesis. This interdependence is the
    basis of the carbon-oxygen cycle (<strong role=
    "strong">Figure</strong> 1.7 <a href="#Bio5-1-8-fig" id=
    "Bio5-1-8-text" name="Bio5-1-8-text">below</a>), which connects
    producers to consumers and their environment. At first glance,
    the cycle merely seems to show mitochondria undoing what
    chloroplasts do; but the cycle&rsquo;s energy transformations
    power all the diversity, beauty, and mystery of life.</p>

    <h3>Glycolysis: A Universal and Ancient Pathway for Making
    ATP</h3>

    <p>When was the last time you enjoyed yogurt on your breakfast
    cereal, or had a tetanus shot? These experiences may appear
    unconnected, but both relate to bacteria which do not use
    oxygen to make ATP. In fact, tetanus bacteria cannot survive if
    oxygen is present. However, <em>Lactobacillus acidophilus</em>
    (bacteria which make yogurt) and <em>Clostridium tetani</em>
    (bacteria which cause tetanus or lockjaw) share with nearly all
    organisms the first stage of cellular respiration, glycolysis
    (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong> 1.8 <a href=
    "#Bio51-07a-fig" id="Bio51-07a-text" name=
    "Bio51-07a-text">below</a>). Because glycolysis is universal,
    whereas aerobic (oxygen-requiring) cellular respiration is not,
    most biologists consider it to be the most fundamental and
    primitive pathway for making ATP.</p>

    <div style=
    "float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class=

      <p><strong>Figure</strong> 1.8</p>

    <p>Return to the overall equation for cellular respiration:</p>

    <div><img src=
    "/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2622" width=
    "256px"></div>

    <p>Like photosynthesis, the process represented by this
    equation is actually many small, individual chemical reactions.
    We grouped the reactions of photosynthesis into two stages, the
    light reactions and the Calvin Cycle. We will divide the
    reactions of cellular respiration into three stages:
    glycolysis, the Krebs Cycle, and the electron transport chain
    (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong> 1.9 <a href=
    "#Bio5-1-10-fig" id="Bio5-1-10-text" name=
    "Bio5-1-10-text">below</a>). In this section, we will explore
    Stage 1, glycolysis - the oldest and most widespread pathway
    for making ATP. Before diving into the details, we must note
    that this first stage of cellular respiration is unique among
    the three stages: it does not require oxygen, and it does not
    take place in the mitochondrion. The chemical reactions of
    glycolysis occur without oxygen in the <strong role=
    "strong">cytosol</strong> of the cell (<strong role=
    "strong">Figure</strong> 1.10 <a href="#Bio5-1-11-fig" id=

      <p><strong>Figure</strong> 1.10</p>
    </div>

    <p>The name for Stage 1 clearly indicates what happens during
    that stage: <em>glyco</em>- refers to glucose, and
    -<em>lysis</em> means "splitting." In glycolysis, within the
    cytosol of the cell, a minimum of eight different enzymes break
    apart glucose into two 3-carbon molecules. The energy released
    in breaking those bonds is transferred to carrier molecules,
    ATP and NADH. <strong role="strong">NADH</strong> temporarily
    holds small amounts of energy which can be used later to build
    ATP. The 3-carbon product of glycolysis is pyruvate, or pyruvic
    acid (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong> 1.11 <a href=
    "#Bio5-1-n1-fig" id="Bio5-1-n1-text" name=
    "Bio5-1-n1-text">below</a>). Overall, glycolysis can be
    represented as shown below:</p>

    <div><img src=
    "/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2610" width=
    "256px"></div>

    <div style=
    "float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class=

      <p><a href="#Bio5-1-n1-text" id="Bio5-1-n1-fig" name=
      "Bio5-1-n1-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p>

      <p><strong>Figure</strong> 1.11</p>
    </div>

    <p>However, even this equation is deceiving. Just the splitting
    of glucose requires many steps, each transferring or capturing
    small amounts of energy. Individual steps appear in
    <strong role="strong">Figure</strong> 1.12 <a href=
    "#Bio_5.1.13-fig" id="Bio_5.1.13-text" name=
    "Bio_5.1.13-text">below</a>. Studying the pathway in detail
    reveals that cells must "spend" or "invest" two ATP in order to
    begin the process of breaking glucose apart. Note that the
    phosphates produced by breaking apart ATP join with glucose,
    making it unstable and more likely to break apart. Later steps
    harness the energy released when glucose splits, and use it to
    build "hot hydrogens" (NAD<sup>+</sup> is reduced to NADH) and
    ATP (ADP + P<sub>i</sub></p>

    <div><img src=
    "/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2605" width=
    "256px"></div>ATP). If you count the ATP produced, you will
    find a net yield of two ATP per glucose (4 produced &ndash; 2
    spent). Remember to double the second set of reactions to
    account for the two 3-carbon molecules which follow that
    pathway! The "hot hydrogens" can power other metabolic
    pathways, or in many organisms, provide energy for further ATP
    synthesis.

    <p>To summarize: In the cytosol of the cell, glycolysis
    transfers some of the chemical energy stored in one molecule of
    glucose to two molecules of ATP and two NADH. This makes (some
    of) the energy in glucose, a universal fuel molecule for cells,
    available to use in cellular work - moving organelles,
    transporting molecules across membranes, or building large
    organic molecules.</p>

    <p>Although glycolysis is universal, pathways leading away from
    glycolysis vary among species depending on the availability of
    oxygen. If oxygen is unavailable, pyruvate may be converted to
    lactic acid or ethanol and carbon dioxide in order to
    regenerate NAD<sup>+</sup>, ending anaerobic respiration.
    <strong role="strong">Anaerobic</strong> respiration is also
    called fermentation, which we will discuss in a later
    section.</p>

    <p>If oxygen is present, pyruvate enters the mitochondria for
    further breakdown, releasing far more energy and producing many
    more molecules of ATP in the latter two stages of aerobic
    respiration - the Krebs cycle and electron transport chain. We
    will explore these, too, in a later section.</p>

    <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Most organisms need oxygen for a single purpose: to
      release energy from food for use by cells.</li>

      <li>Cellular respiration is a series of chemical reactions
      which transfer energy from glucose (deliverable or fuel
      energy) to ATP (usable energy).</li>

      <li>Analyzing a campfire can clarify your understanding of
      cellular respiration. A campfire breaks chemical bonds in
      wood, releasing stored energy as light and heat; respiration
      breaks chemical bonds in glucose, releasing stored energy and
      transferring some to 38 ATP; some energy is lost as
      heat.</li>

      <li>This equation summarizes the process of cellular
      respiration:</li>
    </ul>

    <div><img src=
    "/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2621" width=
    "256px"></div>

    <ul>
      <li>In eukaryotic cells, organelles called mitochondria
      sequence enzymes and electron carriers and compartmentalize
      ions so that cellular respiration proceeds efficiently.</li>

      <li>Cellular respiration, in many ways the opposite of
      photosynthesis, shows the interdependence of producers and
      consumers. Combined, the two equations demonstrate how energy
      flows and the carbon and oxygen cycle between organisms and
      environment.</li>

      <li>The process of cellular respiration is actually many
      separate reactions, which can be divided into three stages:
      glycolysis, the Krebs Cycle, and the electron transport
      chain.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Review Questions</h3>

    <ol start="">
      <li>Why do nearly all organisms die without a constant supply
      of oxygen?</li>

      <li>What source of energy do cells use to build ATP by
      cellular respiration?</li>

      <li>Compare the purpose and energy content of glucose to the
      function and energy content of ATP; in other words, why do
      organisms need both kinds of energy-rich molecules?</li>

      <li>Compare the process of burning gasoline in your
      automobile&rsquo;s engine to the process of cellular
      respiration in terms of reactants, products, and necessary
      conditions.</li>

      <li>Write out the chemical reaction which summarizes the
      overall process of cellular respiration, first in symbols as
      a chemical equation, and then in words in a complete
      sentence.</li>

      <li>In what eukaryote organelle does cellular respiration
      take place? Does this mean that prokaryotes cannot carry out
      the entire process of cellular respiration? Explain.</li>

      <li>Compare and contrast cellular respiration and
      photosynthesis.</li>

      <li>Diagram the carbon-oxygen cycle which connects producers,
      consumers, and their environment. (P = producer, C =
      consumer).</li>

      <li>List the three stages of cellular respiration, and
      contrast the first stage with the other two in terms of
      distribution throughout the living world, location within the
      cell, and use of oxygen.</li>

    <h3>Points to Consider</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>In this lesson, you&rsquo;ve learned that scientists
      consider glycolysis to be the oldest, or at least one of the
      oldest, pathways for making ATP. What might this say about
      earth&rsquo;s ancient atmosphere? Can you imagine steps or
      events that might have been involved in the later evolution
      of aerobic cellular respiration, which includes
      glycolysis?</li>

      <li>Prokaryotes can use either photosynthesis or cellular
      respiration &ndash; or both - to make ATP. Why do you think
      both processes evolved? Why not just photosynthesis? Which do
      you think came first in evolution? Why?</li>

      <li>This lesson compares cellular respiration to burning.
      What activities in your daily life use burning? What are some
      consequences of those activities, in terms of materials
      produced and energy used?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>Enticing clues - volcanic gases, vast iron ore sediments,
    and bubbles of ancient air trapped in amber &ndash; suggest
    dramatic changes during the history of earth&rsquo;s
    atmosphere. Correlating these clues with the fossil record
    leads to two major conclusions: that early life evolved in the
    absence of oxygen, and that oxygen first appeared between 2 and
    3 billion years ago (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong> 1.13
    <a href="#Bio_5.2.1-fig" id="Bio_5.2.1-text" name=

    bluegreen bacteria (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong> 1.14
    <a href="#Bio52-02a-fig" id="Bio52-02a-text" name=
    "Bio52-02a-text">below</a>). The chemistry of cellular
    respiration reflects this history. Its first stage,
    <strong role="strong">glycolysis</strong>, is universal and
    does not use oxygen.</p>

    <p>Absolutely dependent on oxygen gas, we find it difficult to
    imagine that its appearance must have been disastrous for the
    anaerobic organisms that evolved in its absence. But oxygen is
    highly reactive, and at first, its effect on evolution was so
    negative that some have named this period the &ldquo;oxygen
    catastrophe.&rdquo; However, as oxygen gradually formed a
    protective ozone layer, life rebounded. After the first
    organisms &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; how to use oxygen to their
    advantage &ndash; in ways we will explore in this chapter
    &ndash; the diversity of aerobic organisms exploded. According
    to the <strong role="strong">endosymbiotic theory</strong>,
    engulfing of some of these aerobic bacteria led to eukaryotic
    cells with mitochondria, and multicellularity followed. Today,
    we live in an atmosphere which is 21% oxygen, and most of life
    follows glycolysis with the last two, aerobic stages of
    cellular respiration.</p>

    <p>Recall the purpose of cellular respiration: to release
    energy from glucose to make <strong role="strong">ATP</strong>
    - the universal &ldquo;currency&rdquo; for cellular work. The
    following equation describes the overall process, although it
    summarizes many individual chemical reactions.</p>

    <div><img src=
    "/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2621" width=
    "256px"></div>

    <p>Once again, the first stage of this process, glycolysis, is
    ancient, universal, and anaerobic. In the cytoplasm of most
    cells, glycolysis breaks each 6-carbon molecule of glucose into
    two 3-carbon molecules of pyruvate. Chemical energy, which had
    been stored in the now broken bonds, is transferred to 2 ATP
    and 2 &ldquo;hot hydrogens,&rdquo; <strong role=
    "strong">NADH</strong>.</p>

    <p>The fate of pyruvate depends on the species and the presence
    or absence of oxygen. If oxygen is present to drive subsequent
    reactions, pruvate enters the mitochondrion, where the
    <strong role="strong">Krebs Cycle</strong> (Stage 2) and
    electron transport chain (Stage 3) break it down and oxidize it
    completely to CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O. The energy
    thus released builds many more ATP molecules, though of course
    some is lost as heat. Let&rsquo;s explore the details of how
    mitochondria use oxygen to make more ATP from glucose by
    aerobic respiration.</p>

    <h3>The Krebs Cycle: Capturing Energy from Pyruvate</h3>

    <p>Aerobic respiration begins with the entry of pyruvate
    (product of glycolysis) into the mitochondria. We will follow
    the six carbons of the original glucose molecule, so we will
    consider two 3-carbon pyruvates. The fate of pyruvate&rsquo;s
    energy and carbon atoms can be followed in the examples
    below:</p>

    <ol start="">
      <li>Within the mitochondria, each pyruvate is broken apart
      and combined with a coenzyme known as CoA to form a 2-carbon
      molecule, Acetyl CoA, which can enter the Krebs Cycle. A
      single atom of carbon (per pyruvate) is &ldquo;lost&rdquo; as
      carbon dioxide. The energy released in this breakdown is
      captured in two &ldquo;hot hydrogen&rdquo; &ndash; NADH. See
      <strong role="strong">Figure</strong> 1.15 <a href=
      "#Bio05-02-03-fig" id="Bio05-02-03-text" name=
      "Bio05-02-03-text">above</a>. Fatty acids can also break down
      into Acetyl CoA. By this means, lipids, like carbohydrates,
      can be &ldquo;burned&rdquo; to make ATP using the Krebs
      Cycle.</li>

      <li>The Krebs Cycle (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong>
      1.16 <a href="#Bio5-2-n2-fig" id="Bio5-2-n2-text" name=
      "Bio5-2-n2-text">above</a>) begins by combining each Acetyl
      CoA with a four-carbon carrier molecule to make a 6-carbon
      molecule of citric acid (or citrate, its ionized form). For
      this reason, the Krebs Cycle, named for a scientist who
      worked out its details, is also called the Citric Acid
      Cycle.</li>

      <li>The cycle carries citric acid through a series of
      chemical reactions which gradually release energy and capture
      it in several carrier molecules. For each Acetyl CoA which
      enters the cycle, 3 NAD+ are reduced to NADH, one molecule of
      FAD (yet another temporary energy carrier we haven&rsquo;t
      met before) is reduced to FADH<sub>2</sub>, and one molecule
      of ATP (actually a precursor, GTP) is made. Study
      <strong role="strong">Figure</strong> 1.16 <a href=
      "#Bio5-2-n2-fig" id="Bio5-2-n2-text" name=
      "Bio5-2-n2-text">above</a> to locate each of these
      energy-capturing events.</li>

      <li>Note what happens to carbon atoms (black dots in
      <strong role="strong">Figure</strong> 1.16 <a href=
      "#Bio5-2-n2-fig" id="Bio5-2-n2-text" name=
      "Bio5-2-n2-text">above</a>). For each 2-carbon Acetyl CoA
      which enters the cycle, two molecules of carbon dioxide are
      released - complete breakdown of the original 6-carbon
      glucose molecule. The final step regenerates the original
      4-carbon molecule which began the cycle, so that another
      Acetyl CoA can enter.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>In summary, the Krebs Cycle completes the breakdown of
    glucose which began with glycolysis. Its chemical reactions
    oxidize all six of the original carbon atoms to CO<sub>2</sub>,
    and capture the energy released in 2 ATP, 6 NADH, and 2
    FADH<sub>2</sub>. These energy carriers join the 2 ATP and 2
    NADH produced in glycolysis and the 2 NADH produced in the
    conversion of 2 pyruvates to 2 Acetyl CoA.</p>

    <p>At the conclusion of the Krebs Cycle, glucose is completely
    broken down, yet only four ATP have been produced. Moreover,
    although oxygen is required to drive the Krebs Cycle, the
    cycle&rsquo;s chemical reactions do not themselves consume
    O<sub>2</sub>. The conclusion of cellular respiration &ndash;
    its &ldquo;grand finale!" &ndash; produces the majority of the
    ATP. The next section will explore the electron transport
    chain, where Stage 3 concludes aerobic cellular
    respiration.</p>

    <h3>Structure of the Mitochondrion: Key to Aerobic
    Respiration</h3>

    <p>As noted earlier, the aerobic phases of cellular respiration
    in eukaryotes occur within organelles called mitochondria. A
    detailed look at the structure of the <strong role=
    "strong">mitochondrion</strong> (<strong role=
    "strong">Figure</strong> 1.17 <a href="#Bio5-2-n3-fig" id=
    "Bio5-2-n3-text" name="Bio5-2-n3-text">below</a>) helps to
    explain its role in the last stage of respiration, the electron
    transport chain.</p>

    <div style=
    "float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class=

      <p><strong>Figure</strong> 1.17</p>
    </div>

    <p>Two separate membranes form the mitochondrion. The inner
    membrane folds into <strong role="strong">cristae</strong>
    which divide the organelle into three compartments &ndash;
    <strong role="strong">intermembrane space</strong> (between
    outer and inner membranes), cristae space (formed by infoldings
    of the inner membrane), and matrix (within the inner membrane).
    The Krebs Cycle takes place within the matrix. The compartments
    are critical for the electron transport chain, as we&rsquo;ll
    see in the final section of this lesson. Glycolysis occurs in
    the cytoplasm of the cell, with the products of glycolysis
    entering the mitochondria to continue cellular respiration.</p>

    <h3>The Electron Transport Chain: ATP for Life in the Fast
    Lane</h3>

    <p>At the end of the Krebs Cycle, energy from the chemical
    bonds of glucose is stored in diverse energy carrier molecules:
    four ATP, but also two <strong role=
    "strong">FADH<sub>2</sub></strong> and ten NADH. The primary
    task of the last stage of cellular respiration, the electron
    transport chain (ETC), is to transfer energy from these
    carriers to ATP, the &ldquo;batteries&rdquo; which power work
    within the cell.</p>

    <p>Pathways for making ATP in stage 3 of aerobic respiration
    closely resemble the electron transport chains used in
    photosynthesis. In both ETCs, energy carrier molecules are
    arranged in sequence within a membrane so that energy-carrying
    electrons cascade from one to another, losing a little energy
    in each step. In both photosynthesis and aerobic respiration,
    the energy lost is harnessed to pump hydrogen ions into a
    compartment, creating an <strong role=
    "strong">electrochemical</strong> or <strong role=
    "strong">chemiosmotic gradient</strong> across the enclosing
    membrane. And in both processes, the energy stored in the
    chemiosmotic gradient is used to build ATP.</p>

    <p>For aerobic respiration, the <strong role="strong">electron
    transport chain</strong> or &ldquo;respiratory chain&rdquo; is
    embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondria
    (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong> 1.18 <a href=
    "#Bio_MET-fig" id="Bio_MET-text" name=
    "Bio_MET-text">below</a>). FADH<sub>2</sub> and NADH (produced
    in glycolysis and the Krebs Cycle) donate high-energy electrons
    to energy carrier molecules within the membrane. As they pass
    from one carrier to another, the energy they lose is used to
    pump hydrogen ions into the intermembrane space, creating an
    electrochemical gradient. Hydrogen ions flow &ldquo;down&rdquo;
    the gradient &ndash; from outer to inner compartment &ndash;
    through an ion channel/enzyme, <strong role="strong">ATP
    synthase,</strong> which transfer their energy to ATP. Note the
    paradox that it requires energy to create and maintain a
    concentration gradient of hydrogen ions that are then used by
    ATP synthase to create stored energy (ATP). In broad terms, it
    takes energy to make energy. Coupling the electron transport
    chain to ATP synthesis with a hydrogen ion gradient is
    chemiosmosis, first described by Nobel laureate Peter D.
    Mitchell.</p>

    <p>After passing through the ETC, low-energy electrons and
    low-energy hydrogen ions combine with oxygen to form water.
    Thus, oxygen&rsquo;s role is to drive the entire set of
    ATP-producing reactions within the mitochondrion by accepting
    &ldquo;spent&rdquo; hydrogens. Oxygen is the final electron
    acceptor; no part of the process - from the Krebs Cycle through
    electron transport chain &ndash; can happen without oxygen.</p>

    <p>The electron transport chain can convert the energy from one
    glucose molecule&rsquo;s worth of FADH<sub>2</sub> and
    NADH+H<sup>+</sup> into as many as 34 ATP. When the four ATP
    produced in glycolysis and the Krebs Cycle are added, the total
    fits the overall equation for aerobic cellular respiration:</p>

    <div><img src=
    "/flexr/api/ext/images?id=2623" width=
    "256px"></div>

    <p>Aerobic respiration is complete. If oxygen is available,
    cellular respiration transfers the energy from one molecule of
    glucose to 38 molecules of ATP, releasing carbon dioxide and
    water as waste. &ldquo;Deliverable&rdquo; food energy has
    become energy which can be used for work within the cell
    &ndash; transport within the cell, pumping ions and molecules
    across membranes, and building large organic molecules. Can you
    see how this could lead to &ldquo;life in the fast lane&rdquo;
    compared to anaerobic respiration (glycolysis alone)?</p>

    <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>

    <p>Introduction to Aerobic Respiration:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Oxygen produced by the first photosynthetic organisms was
      probably toxic to the anaerobic life forms which then
      populated the earth, but later organisms evolved a way to
      harness the power of oxygen to make ATP. This new pathway was
      aerobic respiration.</li>

      <li>In eukaryotic cells, if oxygen is present, the pyruvate
      molecules produced by glycolysis in the cytoplasm enter the
      mitochondria for further breakdown and energy release.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Krebs Cycle harnesses the energy which remains in
    pyruvate after glycolysis.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>For most organisms, if oxygen is present, the products of
      glycolysis enter the mitochondria for stage 2 of cellular
      respiration - the Krebs cycle.</li>

      <li>In the mitochondrion, 3-carbon pyruvate combines with
      Coenzyme A to form 2-carbon Acetyl CoA and CO<sub>2</sub>,
      storing released energy in NADH.</li>

      <li>Acetyl CoA enters the Krebs Cycle by combining with a
      4-carbon molecule to form citric acid.</li>

      <li>The Krebs Cycle removes energy from citric acid in small
      steps, storing it in diverse energy carrier molecules: ATP,
      NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub>.</li>

      <li>The Krebs Cycle produces two molecules of CO<sub>2</sub>
      per Acetyl CoA, completing the breakdown of glucose.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Mitochondria are organelles whose membranes are specialized
    for aerobic respiration.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The matrix of the mitochondria is the site of Krebs Cycle
      reactions.</li>

      <li>The electron transport chain and most ATP synthesis rely
      on the compartments created by the inner membrane of the
      mitochondria.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The third and final stage of aerobic cellular respiration,
    the electron transport chain, accounts for most of the ATP.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Stage 3 transfers the energy from NADH and
      FADH<sub>2</sub> to make ATP.</li>

      <li>High-energy electrons from these two energy carriers pass
      along electron acceptors embedded in the inner membrane of
      the mitochondria.</li>

      <li>As the electrons flow, the electron acceptors capture
      small amounts of energy to pump hydrogen ions out into the
      intermembrane space.</li>

      <li>These concentrated hydrogen ions store potential energy
      as an electrochemical gradient.</li>

      <li>Hydrogen ions flow back into the inner membrane space
      through channel proteins, which use their energy to build
      ATP. This is chemiosmosis.</li>

      <li>The ETC coupled with the hydrogen ion flow can build 34
      ATP per glucose molecule.</li>

      <li>When ATP from glycolysis and the Krebs Cycle are added, a
      total of 38 ATP result from aerobic respiration of one
      molecule of glucose.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>After the photosynthetic &ldquo;oxygen catastrophe&rdquo;
    challenged life between 2.5 and 3 billion years ago, evolution
    rebounded with biochemical pathways to harness and protect
    against oxygen&rsquo;s power. Today, most organisms use
    O<sub>2</sub> in aerobic respiration to produce ATP. Almost all
    animals, most fungi, and some bacteria are <strong role=
    "strong">obligate aerobes</strong>, which require oxygen. Some
    plants and fungi and many bacteria retain the ability to make
    ATP without oxygen. These <strong role="strong">facultative
    anaerobes</strong> use ancient anaerobic pathways when oxygen
    is limited. A few bacteria remain as <strong role=
    "strong">obligate anaerobes</strong>, which die in the presence
    of oxygen and depend on only the first (anaerobic) stage of
    cellular respiration.</p>

    <p>Aerobic and anaerobic pathways diverge after glycolysis
    splits glucose into two molecules of pyruvate:</p>

      <p><strong>Figure</strong> 1.19</p>
    </div>

    <p>Pyruvate still contains a great deal of chemical energy. If
    oxygen is present, pyruvate enters the mitochondria for
    complete breakdown by the Krebs Cycle and electron transport
    chain. If oxygen is not present, cells must transform pyruvate
    to regenerate NAD+ in order to continue making ATP. Two
    different pathways accomplish this with rather famous products:
    lactic acid and ethyl alcohol (<strong role=
    "strong">Figure</strong> 1.19 <a href="#Bio5-3-1-fig" id=
    "Bio5-3-1-text" name="Bio5-3-1-text">above</a>). Making ATP in
    the absence of oxygen by glycolysis alone is known as
    fermentation. Therefore, these two pathways are called
    <strong role="strong">lactic acid fermentation</strong> and
    <strong role="strong">alcoholic fermentation</strong>. If you
    lack interest in organisms, such as yeast and bacteria, which
    have &ldquo;stuck with&rdquo; the anaerobic tradition, the
    products of these chemical reactions may still intrigue you.
    Fermentation makes bread, yogurt, beer, wine, and some new
    biofuels. In addition, some of your body&rsquo;s cells are
    facultative anaerobes, retaining one of these ancient pathways
    for short-term, emergency use.</p>

    <h3>Lactic Acid Fermentation: Muscle Cells and Yogurt</h3>

    dark? Do you consider yourself a sprinter, or a distance
    runner? (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong> 1.20 <a href=

    <h4>Are Drumsticks and Athletic Prowess Related?</h4>

    <p>Yes! Muscle color reflects its specialization for aerobic or
    anaerobic metabolism. Although humans are obligate aerobes, our
    muscle cells have not given up on ancient pathways which allow
    them to keep producing ATP quickly when oxygen runs low. The
    difference is more pronounced in chickens and grouse
    (<strong role="strong">Figure</strong> 1.21 <a href=
    "#Bio53-03aa-fig" id="Bio53-03aa-text" name=
    "Bio53-03aa-text">below</a>), which stand around all day on
    their legs. For long periods of time, they carry out aerobic
    respiration in their &ldquo;specialized-for-endurance&rdquo;
    red muscles. If you have ever hunted grouse, you know that
    these birds &ldquo;flush&rdquo; with great speed over short
    distances. Such &ldquo;sprinting&rdquo; flight depends on
    anaerobic respiration in the white cells of breast and wing
    muscle. No human muscle is all red or all white, but chances
    are, if you excel at running short distances or at weight
    lifting, you have more white glycolytic fibers in your leg
    muscles. If you run marathons, you probably have more red
    oxidative fibers.</p>

    others) and by your own muscle cells when you work them hard
    and fast. Converting pyruvate to 3-carbon lactic acid (see
    <strong role="strong">Figure</strong> below) regenerates NAD+
    so that glycolysis can continue to make ATP in low-oxygen
    conditions.</p>

    <p>You may have noticed this type of fermentation in your own
    muscles, because muscle fatigue and pain are associated with
    lactic acid. Keep this in mind, however, as we discuss a second
    type of fermentation, which produces alcohol. Imagine what
    would happen as you ran a race if muscle cells conducted
    alcoholic rather than lactic acid fermentation!</p>

    <h3>Alcoholic Fermentation: A &ldquo;New&rdquo; Source of
    Energy?</h3>

    <p>Have you fueled your car with corn? You have, if you bought
    gas within the city of Portland, Oregon. Portland was the first
    city to require that all gasoline sold within the city limits
    contain at least 10% ethanol. By mid-2006, nearly 6 million
    &ldquo;flex-fuel&rdquo; vehicles &ndash; which can use gasoline
    blends up to 85% ethanol (E85 &ndash; <strong role=

    traveling US roads. This &ldquo;new&rdquo; industry employs an
    &ldquo;old&rdquo; crew of yeast and bacteria to make ethanol by
    an even older biochemical pathway &ndash; <strong role=
    "strong">alcoholic fermentation</strong>. Many people consider
    &ldquo;renewable&rdquo; biofuels such as ethanol a partial
    solution to the declining availability of
    &ldquo;nonrenewable&rdquo; fossil fuels. Although controversy
    still surrounds the true efficiency of producing fuel from
    corn, ethanol is creeping into the world fuel resource picture

    <p>You are probably most familiar with the term "fermentation"
    in terms of alcoholic beverages. You may not have considered
    that the process is actually a chemical reaction certain
    bacteria and yeasts use to make ATP. Like lactic acid
    fermentation, alcoholic fermentation processes pyruvate one
    step further in order to regenerate NAD+ so that glycolysis can
    continue to make ATP. In this form of anaerobic respiration,
    pyruvate is broken down into ethyl alcohol and carbon
    dioxide:</p>

    respiration for many commercial purposes. When you make bread,
    you employ the yeast to make the bread &ldquo;rise&rdquo; by
    producing bubbles of carbon dioxide gas. Why do you suppose
    that eating bread does not intoxicate you?</p>

    <p>Brewers of beer and wine use yeast to add alcohol to
    beverages. Traditional varieties of yeast not only make but
    also limit the quantity of alcohol in these beverages, because
    above 18% by volume, alcohol becomes toxic to the yeast itself!
    We have recently developed new strains of yeast which can
    tolerate up to 25% alcohol by volume. These are used primarily
    in the production of ethanol fuel.</p>

    <p>Human use of alcoholic fermentation depends on the chemical
    energy remaining in pyruvate after glycolysis. Transforming
    pyruvate does not add ATP to that produced in glycolysis, and
    for anaerobic organisms, this is the end of the ATP-producing
    line. All types of anaerobic respiration yield only 2 ATP per
    glucose. In the next section, we will compare the advantages
    and disadvantages of aerobic and anaerobic respiration.</p>

    <h3>Aerobic vs. Anaerobic Respiration: A Comparison</h3>

    <p>As aerobes in a world of <strong role=
    "strong">aerobic</strong> organisms, we tend to consider
    aerobic respiration &ldquo;better&rdquo; than <strong role=
    "strong">fermentation</strong>. In some ways, it is. However,
    anaerobic respiration has persisted far longer on this planet,
    through major changes in atmosphere and life. There must be
    value in this alternative way of making ATP. In this last
    section, we will compare the advantages and disadvantages of
    these two types of respiration.</p>

    <p>A major argument in favor of aerobic over anaerobic
    respiration is overall energy production. Without oxygen,
    organisms can only break 6-carbon glucose into two 3-carbon
    molecules. As we saw earlier, glycolysis releases only enough
    energy to produce two (net) ATP per molecule of glucose. In
    contrast, aerobic respiration breaks glucose all the way down
    to CO<sub>2</sub>, producing up to 38 ATP. Membrane transport
    costs can reduce this theoretical yield, but aerobic
    respiration consistently produces at least 15 times as much ATP
    as anaerobic respiration. This vast increase in energy
    production probably explains why aerobic organisms have come to
    dominate life on earth. It may also explain how organisms were
    able to increase in size, adding multicellularity and great
    diversity.</p>

    <p>However, anaerobic pathways persist, and a few obligate
    anaerobes have survived over 2 billion years beyond the
    evolution of aerobic respiration. What are the advantages of
    fermentation?</p>

    <p>One advantage is available to organisms occupying the few
    anoxic (lacking oxygen) niches remaining on earth. Oxygen
    remains the highly reactive, toxic gas which caused the
    &ldquo;Oxygen Catastrophe.&rdquo; Aerobic organisms have merely
    learned a few tricks &ndash; enzymes and antioxidants - to
    protect themselves. Organisms living in anoxic niches do not
    run the risk of oxygen exposure, so they do not need to spend
    energy to build these elaborate chemicals.</p>

    <p>Individual cells which experience anoxic conditions face
    greater challenges. We mentioned earlier that muscle cells
    &ldquo;still remember&rdquo; anaerobic respiration, using
    lactic acid fermentation to make ATP in low-oxygen conditions.
    Brain cells do not &ldquo;remember&rdquo;, and consequently
    cannot make any ATP without oxygen. This explains why death
    follows for most humans who endure more than four minutes
    without oxygen.</p>

    <p>Variation in muscle cells gives further insight into some
    benefits of anaerobic respiration. In vertebrate muscles,
    lactic acid fermentation allows muscles to produce ATP quickly
    during short bursts of strenuous activity. Muscle cells
    specialized for this type of activity show differences in
    structure as well as chemistry. Red muscle fibers are
    &ldquo;dark&rdquo; because they have a rich blood supply for a
    steady supply of oxygen, and a protein, myoglobin, which holds
    extra oxygen. They also contain more mitochondria, the
    organelle in which the Krebs cycle and electron transport chain
    conclude aerobic respiration. White muscle cells are
    &ldquo;light&rdquo; because they lack the rich blood supply,
    have fewer mitochondria, and store glycogen rather than oxygen.
    When you eat dark meat, you are eating endurance muscle. When
    you eat white meat, you are eating muscle built for
    sprinting.</p>

    <p>Each type of muscle fiber has advantages and disadvantages,
    which reflect their differing biochemical pathways. Aerobic
    respiration in red muscles produces a great deal of ATP from
    far less glucose - but slowly, over a long time. Anaerobic
    respiration in white muscles produces ATP rapidly for quick
    bursts of speed, but a predator who continues pursuit may
    eventually catch a white-muscled prey.</p>

    <p>In summary, aerobic and anaerobic respiration each have
    advantages under specific conditions. Aerobic respiration
    produces far more ATP, but risks exposure to oxygen toxicity.
    Anaerobic respiration is less energy-efficient, but allows
    survival in habitats which lack oxygen. Within the human body,
    both are important to muscle function. Muscle cells specialized
    for aerobic respiration provide endurance, and those
    specialized for lactic acid fermentation support short but
    intense energy expenditures. Both ways of making ATP play
    critical roles in life on earth.</p>

    <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>In the two to three billion years since photosynthesis
      added oxygen to earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, life has become
      mostly aerobic. Some organisms and types of cells retain the
      older, anaerobic pathways for making ATP; these pathways
      comprise anaerobic respiration or fermentation.</li>

      <li>Obligate aerobes require oxygen to make ATP. Obligate
      anaerobes cannot survive in the presence of oxygen, so they
      occupy only anoxic habitats. Facultative anaerobes make ATP
      with oxygen, but if oxygen levels become low, they can use
      fermentation.</li>

      <li>Some bacteria, including those we employ to make yogurt,
      make ATP using lactic acid fermentation; the acid may help
      reduce competition from other bacteria. Muscle cells can
      continue to produce ATP when O<sub>2</sub> runs low using
      lactic acid fermentation, but muscle fatigue and pain may
      result.</li>

      <li>Red muscle fibers use mostly aerobic respiration to make
      ATP for endurance tasks; white muscle fibers use mostly
      lactic acid fermentation to make ATP quickly for short,
      intense activities. Human muscles contain a mixture of red
      and white fibers, but genetics may give sprinters more white
      fibers, and marathoners more red.</li>

      <li>Both alcoholic and lactic acid fermentation pathways
      change pyruvate in order to continue producing ATP by
      glycolysis.</li>

      <li>Ethanol produced by bacteria through alcoholic
      fermentation of corn (and perhaps other fuels in the near
      future) may provide a more renewable fuel for vehicles than
      the fossil fuels upon which we currently depend. We employ
      yeasts to help make bread through alcoholic fermentation; as
      they produce carbon dioxide, the bread dough rises. We employ
      anaerobic organisms to make beer and wine through alcoholic
      fermentation; the alcohol content is limited to 18% by volume
      because levels above that are toxic to these organisms.</li>

      <li>Aerobic respiration is far more energy-efficient than
      anaerobic respiration. Aerobic processes produce up to 38 ATP
      per glucose. Anaerobic processes yield only 2 ATP per
      glucose.</li>
    </ul>

        bacteria are obligate anaerobes, which cannot grow in the

        Bubbles of oxygen appear at the surface above a mat of
        bluegreen bacteria in a freshwater pond. Studies of the
        fossil record and earths atmosphere suggest that life
        evolved before bacteria similar to these first added
        oxygen.

        After glycolysis, two 3-carbon pyruvates enter the
        mitochondrion, where they are converted to two 2-carbon
        acetyl CoenzymeA (CoA) molecules. Acetyl CoA then enters
        the Krebs Cycle. Note that the carbons removed become
        carbon dioxide, accounting for two of the six such end
        products of glucose oxidation. The energy released by this
        breakdown is carried by hot hydrogen.&amp;quot;

      <caption>
        The Krebs or Citric Acid Cycle completes the breakdown of
        glucose begun in glycolysis. If oxygen is present, pyruvate
        enters the mitochondria and is converted to Acetyl CoA.
        Acetyl CoA enters the cycle by combining with 4-carbon
        oxaloacetate. Study the diagram to confirm that each turn
        of the cycle (two for each glucose) stores energy in 3
        NADH+H, one FADH, and one ATP (from GTP), and releases 2
        CO.

      <caption>
        Mitochondria, organelles specialized to carry out aerobic
        respiration, contain an inner membrane folded into cristae,
        which form two separate kinds of compartments: inner
        membrane space and matrix. The Krebs Cycle takes place in
        the . The electron transport chain is embedded in the inner
        membrane and uses both compartments to make ATP by .
      </caption>

      <caption>
        The third stage of photosynthesis uses the energy stored
        earlier in NADH and FADH to make ATP. Electron transport
        chains embedded in the inner membrane capture high-energy
        electrons from the carrier molecules and use them to
        concentrate hydrogen ions in the intermembrane space.
        Hydrogen ions flow down their electrochemical gradient back
        into the matrix through channels which capture their energy
        to convert ADP to ATP.

        Anaerobic and aerobic respiration share the glycolysis
        pathway. If oxygen is not present, fermentation may take
        place, producing lactic acid or ethyl alcohol and carbon
        dioxide. Products of fermentation still contain chemical
        energy, and are used widely to make foods and fuels.

        Light meat or dark? Sprinting or endurance? Muscle cells
        know two ways of making ATP aerobic and anaerobic
        respiration.

        Ruffed grouse use anaerobic respiration (lactic acid
        fermentation) in wing and breast muscles for quick bursts
        of speed to escape from predators (and hunters!).
      </caption>

      <caption>
        bacteria use the same type of anaerobic respiration as our
        muscle cells. Lactic acid reduces competition from other
        bacteria, and flavors yogurt, as well!

        Ethanol provides up to 85% of the energy needs of new
        fuel-flex cars. Although its energy efficiency is still
        controversial, ethanol from corn or cellulose appears to be
        more renewable than fossil fuels.
      </caption>

      <caption>
        One of the newest kids on the block, ethanol from corn or
        cellulose is produced by yeasts through alcoholic
        fermentation an anaerobic type of respiration.
      </caption>

      <caption>
        Yeasts are facultative anaerobes, which means that in the
        absence of oxygen, they use alcoholic fermentation to
        produce ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide. Both products are
        important commercially.
      </caption>

      <caption>
        We employ yeasts to use their anaerobic talents to help
        bread rise (via bubbles of CO2) and grapes ferment (adding
        ethanol).
