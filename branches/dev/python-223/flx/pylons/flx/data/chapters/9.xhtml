  <h2>The Big Idea</h2>

  <p>The law of <em>conservation of momentum</em> states that in
  any closed system (including the universe) the total quantity of
  momentum is constant. Momentum can be transferred from one body
  to another, but none is lost or gained. If a system has its
  momentum changed from the outside it is caused by an
  <em>impulse,</em> which transfers momentum from one body to
  another.</p>

  <p>When any two bodies in the universe interact, they can
  exchange energy, momentum, or both. We saw in an earlier chapter
  that the law of <em>conservation of energy</em> states that in
  any closed system (including the universe) the total quantity of
  energy remains fixed. Energy is transferred from one form to
  another, but not lost or gained. If energy is put into a system
  from the outside or vice versa it is often in the form of
  <em>work,</em> which is a transfer of energy between bodies.</p>

  <p>At this point, we have an opportunity to explore the
  relationship between force, energy and work. These are really
  important concepts in physics, so we should take our time to
  understand them. At this point the situation can be summarized
  like this: energy is the capacity to create motion or change,
  force is what creates the change, and work is a book keeping tool
  to keep track of forces.</p>

  <h2>Math of Force, Energy, and Work</h2>

  <p>When an object moves in the direction of an applied force, we
  say that the force does <strong>work</strong> on the object. Note
  that the force may be slowing the object down, speeding it up,
  maintaining its velocity --- any number of things. In all cases,
  the net work done is given by this formula: <img class=
  "x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0AW%20%3D%20%5Cvec%7BF%7D%5Ccdot%20%5Cvec%7Bd%7D%20%3D%20%5Cvec%7BF%7D%5Ccdot%20%5CDelta%20%5Cvec%7Bx%7D%20%26%26%20%5Ctext%7B%5B1%5D%20Work%20is%20the%20dot%20product%20of%20force%20and%20displacement.%7D%0A"
  alt=
  "W = \vec{F}\cdot \vec{d} = \vec{F}\cdot \Delta \vec{x} &amp;&amp; \text{[1] Work is the dot product of force and displacement.}">
  In other words, if an object has traveled a distance <img class=
  "x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20d%20" alt=" d "> under
  force <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20%5Cvec%7BF%7D%20" alt=" \vec{F} ">, the
  work done on it will equal to <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20d%20" alt=" d "> multiplied by the
  component of <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%5Cvec%7BF%7D" alt="\vec{F}"> along the
  object's path. Consider the following example of a block moving
  horizontally with a force applied at some angle:</p>

  <p><img src="/rpc/ck12/images?id=83" alt="" width="300px"></p>

  <p>Here the net work done on the object by the force will be
  <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=F%20d%20%5Ccos%20%5Ctheta" alt=
  "F d \cos \theta">.</p>

  <h2>Work-Energy Principle</h2>

  <p>The reason the concept of work is so useful is because of a
  theorem, called the <strong>work-energy principle</strong>, which
  states that <em>the change in an object's kinetic energy is equal
  to the net work done on it</em>: <img class="x-ck12-block-math"
  src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0A%5CDelta%20K_e%20%3DW_%7Bnet%7D%20%5Ctext%7B%20%5B2%5D%7D%0A"
  alt="\Delta K_e =W_{net} \text{ [2]}"> Although we cannot derive
  this principle in general, we can do it for the case that
  interests us most: constant acceleration. In the following
  derivation, we assume that the force is along motion. This
  doesn't reduce the generality of the result, but makes the
  derivation more tractable because we don't need to worry about
  vectors or angles.</p>

  <p>Recall that an object's kinetic energy is given by the
  formula: <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0AK_e%20%3D%20%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7Dmv%5E2%20%5Ctext%7B%20%5B3%5D%20%7D%0A"
  alt="K_e = \tfrac{1}{2}mv^2 \text{ [3] }"> Consider an object of
  mass <img class="x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20m%20"
  alt=" m "> accelerated from a velocity <img class="x-ck12-math"
  src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20v_i%20" alt=" v_i "> to <img class=
  "x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20v_f%20" alt=" v_f ">
  under a constant force. The change in kinetic energy, according
  to [2], is equal to: <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0A%5CDelta%20K_e%20%3D%20K_%7Bei%7D-%20K_%7Bef%7D%20%3D%20%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7Dmv_f%5E2-%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7Dmv_i%5E2%20%3D%20%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7Dm%28v_f%5E2-v_i%5E2%29%20%5Ctext%7B%20%5B4%5D%20%7D%0A"
  alt=
  "\Delta K_e = K_{ei}- K_{ef} = \tfrac{1}{2}mv_f^2-\tfrac{1}{2}mv_i^2 = \tfrac{1}{2}m(v_f^2-v_i^2) \text{ [4] }">
  Now let's see how much work this took. To find this, we need to
  find the distance such an object will travel under these
  conditions. We can do this by using the third of our 'Big three'
  equations, namely: <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0A%7Bv_f%7D%5E2%20%20%3D%20%20%20%7Bv_i%7D%5E2%20%2B%202a%5CDelta%20x%20%5Ctext%7B%20%5B5%5D%7D%0A%5Cintertext%7Balternatively%2C%7D%0A%5CDelta%20x%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%7Bv_f%7D%5E2-%7Bv_i%7D%5E2%7D%7B2a%7D%20%5Ctext%7B%20%5B6%5D%20%7D%0A"
  alt=
  "{v_f}^2 = {v_i}^2 + 2a\Delta x \text{ [5]} \intertext{alternatively,} \Delta x = \frac{{v_f}^2-{v_i}^2}{2a} \text{ [6] }">
  Plugging in [6] and Newton's Third Law, <img class="x-ck12-math"
  src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%7BF%7D%20%3D%20ma%20" alt="{F} = ma ">,
  into [2], we find: <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0AW%20%3D%20F%20%5CDelta%20x%20%3D%20ma%5Ctimes%20%5Cfrac%7B%7Bv_f%7D%5E2-%7Bv_i%7D%5E2%7D%7B2a%7D%20%3D%20%20%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7Dm%28v_f%5E2-v_i%5E2%29%5Ctext%7B%20%5B7%5D%2C%7D%0A"
  alt=
  "W = F \Delta x = ma\times \frac{{v_f}^2-{v_i}^2}{2a} = \tfrac{1}{2}m(v_f^2-v_i^2)\text{ [7],}">
  which was our result in [4].</p>

  <h3>Using the Work-Energy Principle</h3>

  <p>The Work-Energy Principle can be used to derive a variety of
  useful results. Consider, for instance, an object dropped a
  height <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20%5CDelta%20h%20" alt=" \Delta h "> under
  the influence of gravity. This object will experience constant
  acceleration. Therefore, we can again use equation [6],
  substituting gravity for acceleration and <img class=
  "x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20%5CDelta%20h%20" alt=
  " \Delta h "> for distance: <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0A%5CDelta%20h%20%26%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%7Bv_f%7D%5E2-%7Bv_i%7D%5E2%7D%7B2g%7D%0A%5Cintertext%7Bmultiplying%20both%20sides%20by%20%24mg%24%2C%20we%20find%3A%7D%0Amg%20%5CDelta%20h%20%26%3D%20m%20%5Ccancel%7Bg%7D%20%5Cfrac%7B%7Bv_f%7D%5E2-%7Bv_i%7D%5E2%7D%7B2%5Ccancel%7Bg%7D%7D%20%3D%20%5CDelta%20K_e%20%5Ctext%7B%20%5B8%5D%7D%20%0A"
  alt=
  "\Delta h &amp;= \frac{{v_f}^2-{v_i}^2}{2g} \intertext{multiplying both sides by $mg$, we find:} mg \Delta h &amp;= m \cancel{g} \frac{{v_f}^2-{v_i}^2}{2\cancel{g}} = \Delta K_e \text{ [8]} ">
  In other words, the work performed on the object by gravity in
  this case is <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=mg%20%5CDelta%20h" alt="mg \Delta h">. We
  refer to this quantity as gravitational potential energy; here,
  we have derived it as a function of height. For most forces
  (exceptions are friction, air resistance, and other forces that
  convert energy into heat), potential energy can be understood as
  the ability to perform work.</p>

  <h3>Spring Force</h3>

  <p>A spring with spring constant <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20k%20" alt=" k "> a distance <img class=
  "x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20%5CDelta%20x%20" alt=
  " \Delta x "> from equilibrium experiences a restorative force
  equal to: <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0AF_s%20%3D%20-k%5CDelta%20x%20%5Ctext%7B%20%5B9%5D%7D%0A"
  alt="F_s = -k\Delta x \text{ [9]}"> This is a force that can
  change an object's kinetic energy, and therefore do work. So, it
  has a potential energy associated with it as well. This quantity
  is given by: <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0AE_%7Bsp%7D%20%3D%20%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7Dk%7B%5CDelta%20x%7D%5E2%20%26%26%20%5Ctext%7B%5B10%5D%20Spring%20Potential%20Energy%7D%0A"
  alt=
  "E_{sp} = \tfrac{1}{2}k{\Delta x}^2 &amp;&amp; \text{[10] Spring Potential Energy}">
  The derivation of [10] is left to the reader. Hint: find the
  average force an object experiences while moving from <img class=
  "x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20x%20%3D%200%20" alt=
  " x = 0 "> to <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20x%20%3D%20%5CDelta%20x%20" alt=
  " x = \Delta x "> while attached to a spring. The net work is
  then this force times the displacement. Since this quantity
  (work) must equal to the change in the object's kinetic energy,
  it is also equal to the potential energy of the spring. This
  derivation is very similar to the derivation of the kinematics
  equations --- look those up.</p>

  </dl>

  <p>One important type of problem is called a
  <strong>collision</strong> problem. In cases where collisions are
  elastic, kinetic energy and momentum are conserved. In inelastic
  collisions, only momentum is conserved.</p>

  <h2>Key Concepts</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>An <strong>impulse</strong> occurs when momentum is
    transferred from one system to another. You can always
    determine the impulse by finding the changes in momentum, which
    are done by forces acting over a period of time. If you graph
    force vs. time of impact, the area under the curve is the
    impulse.</li>

    <li>Work is simply how much energy was transferred from one
    system to another system. You can always find the work done
    <em>on</em> an object (or done <em>by</em> an object) by
    determining how much energy has been transferred into or out of
    the object through forces. If you graph force vs. distance, the
    area under the curve is work. (The semantics take some getting
    used to: if <em>you</em> do work on <em>me,</em> then you have
    lost energy, and I have gained energy.)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Key Applications</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>When working a problem that asks for <em>height</em> or
    <em>speed,</em> energy conservation is almost always the
    easiest approach.</li>

    <li>Potential energy of gravity, <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
    "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%20U_g" alt=" U_g">, is always measured
    with respect to some arbitrary &lsquo;zero&rsquo; height
    defined to be where the gravitational potential energy is zero.
    You can set this height equal to zero at any altitude you like.
    Be consistent with your choice throughout the problem. Often it
    is easiest to set it to zero at the lowest point in the
    problem.</li>

    <li>Some problems require you to use both energy conservation
    <em>and</em> momentum conservation. Remember, in every
    collision, momentum is conserved. Kinetic energy, on the other
    hand, is not always conserved, since some kinetic energy may be
    lost to heat.</li>

    <li>If a system involves no energy losses due to heat or sound,
    no change in potential energy and no work is done by anybody to
    anybody else, then kinetic energy is conserved. Collisions
    where this occurs are called <em>elastic.</em> In elastic
    collisions, both kinetic energy and momentum are conserved. In
    <em>inelastic</em> collisions kinetic energy is not conserved;
    only momentum is conserved.</li>

    <li>Sometimes energy is &ldquo;lost&rdquo; when crushing an
    object. For instance, if you throw silly putty against a wall,
    much of the energy goes into flattening the silly putty
    (changing intermolecular bonds). Treat this as lost energy,
    similar to sound, chemical changes, or heat. In an inelastic
    collision, things stick, energy is lost, and so kinetic energy
    is not conserved.</li>

    <li>When calculating work, use the component of the force that
    is in the same direction as the motion. Components of force
    perpendicular to the direction of the motion don&rsquo;t do
    work. (Note that centripetal forces never do work, since they
    are always perpendicular to the direction of motion.)</li>

    <li>When calculating impulse the time to use is when the force
    is in contact with the body.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Work and Energy Examples</h2>

  <h3>Example 1</h3>

  <p><strong>Question</strong>: A pile driver lifts a 500 kg mass a
  vertical distance of 20 m in 1.1 sec. It uses 225 kW of supplied
  power to do this.</p>

  <p>a) How much work was done by the pile driver?</p>

  <p>b) How much power was used in actually lifting the mass?</p>

  <p>c) What is the efficiency of the machine? (This is the ratio
  of power used to power supplied.)</p>

  <p>d) The mass is dropped on a pile and falls 20 m. If it loses
  40,000 J on the way down to the ground due to air resistance,
  what is its speed when it hits the pile?</p>

  <p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>

  <p>a) We will use the equation for work and plug in the known
  values to get the amount of work done by the pile driver.
  <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0AW%3DFd%3Dmad%3D500%5Cmathrm%7Bkg%7D%5Ctimes%209.8%5Cmathrm%7Bm/s%5E2%7D%5Ctimes%2020%5Cmathrm%7Bm%7D%3D9.8%5Ctimes%2010%5E4%5Cmathrm%7BJ%7D%0A"
  alt=
  "W=Fd=mad=500\mathrm{kg}\times 9.8\mathrm{m/s^2}\times 20\mathrm{m}=9.8\times 10^4\mathrm{J}"></p>

  <p>b) We will use the power equation and plug in the known values
  to the power used. <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0AP%3D%5Cfrac%7BW%7D%7B%5Cdelta%20t%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7B9.8%5Ctimes%2010%5E4%5Cmathrm%7BJ%7D%7D%7B1.1%5Cmathrm%7Bs%7D%7D%3D89000%5Cmathrm%7BW%7D%20%5Ctimes%20%5Cfrac%7B1%20%5Cmathrm%7BkW%7D%7D%7B1000%5Cmathrm%7BW%7D%7D%3D89%5Cmathrm%7BkW%7D%0A"
  alt=
  "P=\frac{W}{\delta t}=\frac{9.8\times 10^4\mathrm{J}}{1.1\mathrm{s}}=89000\mathrm{W} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{kW}}{1000\mathrm{W}}=89\mathrm{kW}"></p>

  <p>c) This is simply a division problem. <img class=
  "x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0A%5Cfrac%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bpower%7Eused%7D%7D%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bpower%7Esupplied%7D%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7B89%5Cmathrm%7BkW%7D%7D%7B225%5Cmathrm%7BkW%7D%7D%3D.40%0A"
  alt=
  "\frac{\mathrm{power~used}}{\mathrm{power~supplied}}=\frac{89\mathrm{kW}}{225\mathrm{kW}}=.40"></p>

  <p>d) We have already solved for the amount of energy the mass
  has after the pile driver performs work on it (it has <img class=
  "x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=9.8%5Ctimes%2010%5E4%5Cmathrm%7BJ%7D" alt=
  "9.8\times 10^4\mathrm{J}">). If on the way down it loses
  <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=40000%5Cmathrm%7BJ%7D" alt=
  "40000\mathrm{J}"> due to air resistance, then it effectively has
  <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0A98000%5Cmathrm%7BJ%7D-40000%5Cmathrm%7BJ%7D%3D58000%5Cmathrm%7BJ%7D%0A"
  alt="98000\mathrm{J}-40000\mathrm{J}=58000\mathrm{J}"> of energy.
  So we will set the kinetic energy equation equal to the total
  energy and solve for v. This will give us the velocity of the
  mass when it hits the ground because right before the mass hits
  the ground, all of the potential energy will have been converted
  into kinetic energy. <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0A58000%5Cmathrm%7BJ%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7Dmv%5E2%20%5CRightarrow%20v%3D%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7B58000%5Cmathrm%7BJ%7D%5Ctimes%202%7D%7Bm%7D%7D%3D%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7B58000%5Cmathrm%7BJ%7D%5Ctimes%202%7D%7B500%5Cmathrm%7Bkg%7D%7D%7D%3D15.2%5Cmathrm%7Bm/s%7D%0A"
  alt=
  "58000\mathrm{J}=\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \Rightarrow v=\sqrt{\frac{58000\mathrm{J}\times 2}{m}}=\sqrt{\frac{58000\mathrm{J}\times 2}{500\mathrm{kg}}}=15.2\mathrm{m/s}"></p>

  <h2>Energy and Force Problem Set</h2>
