  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>In most multicellular organisms, not all cells are alike. For
  example, the cells that make up your skin are different from
  cells that make up your liver, your blood, or your eyes. Yet, all
  these specialized cells develop from one single fertilized egg
  which means all of your cells have the same DNA. But liver,
  blood, and eye cells are very different from each other in form
  and function. While these cells are specialized for a specific
  job, there are other cells in the body that remain unspecialized.
  These cells multiply continuously to replace the millions of
  different body cells that die and need to be replaced every
  day.</p>

  <h3>Cells</h3>

  <p><strong role="strong">Cells</strong> are the most basic units
  of life in your body. Each specialized cell has a specific
  function in the body. For example, nerve cells transmit
  electrical messages around the body, and white blood cells patrol
  the body and attack invading bacteria. Other cells include
  specialized cells in the kidney (such as kidney glomerulus
  parietal cell), brain cells (such as astrocytes), stomach cells
  (such as parietal cells), and muscle cells (such as red and white
  skeletal muscle fibers). Cells group together in tissues to carry
  out a specific function, and different tissues work together to
  form organs. This grouping of cells and tissues is referred to as
  levels of organization. Complex multicellular organisms, which
  include flatworms and humans, have different levels of
  organization.</p>

  <h4>Differentiation</h4>

  <p>Every cell in the body originated from a single fertilized
  egg, which is called a zygote. The zygote divides many times to
  produce an embryo. These embryonic cells differentiate into many
  different cell types which in time give rise to all the cells
  types present in the body of all humans (and other mammals), from
  a new-born baby to an elderly adult. <strong role=
  "strong">Differentiation</strong> is the process by which an
  unspecialized cell (such as a fertilized egg cell), divides many
  times to produce specialized cells that work together and make up
  the body. During differentiation, certain genes are turned on, or
  become activated, while other genes are switched off, or
  inactivated. This process is regulated by the cell. A
  differentiated cell will develop specific structures and perform
  certain functions.</p>

  <p>A cell that is able to differentiate into all cell types
  within a body is called <strong role=
  "strong">totipotent</strong>. They have &ldquo;total
  potential&rdquo; to differentiate into any cell type. In mammals,
  only the zygote and early embryonic cells are totipotent. A cell
  that is able to differentiate into many cell types, but not all,
  is called <strong role="strong">pluripotent</strong>. Such cells
  have &ldquo;plural potential,&rdquo; (but not &ldquo;total
  potential&rdquo;) to differentiate into most but not all cell
  types.</p>

    <h4>Stem Cells</h4>

    <p>An unspecialized cell that can divide many times and give
    rise to different, specialized cells is called a <strong role=
    "strong">stem cell</strong>, as shown in <strong role=
    "strong">Figure</strong> 1.1 <a href="#Bio35a-1-1-fig" id=
    "Bio35a-1-1-text" name="Bio35a-1-1-text">above</a>. Zygotes and
    embryonic cells are both types of stem cells. The stem cells
    found in embryos can divide indefinitely, can specialize into
    any cell type and are called <strong role="strong">embryonic
    stem cells</strong>. Embryonic stem cells are totipotent.
    Undifferentiated cells that are found within the body and that
    divide to replace dying cells and damaged tissues are called
    <strong role="strong">adult stem cells</strong>. Adult stem
    cells can divide indefinitely, and generate all the cell types
    of the organ from which they originate. They can potentially
    re-grow the entire organ from just a few cells. A third type of
    stem cell is found in blood from the umbilical cord of a
    new-born baby, and the placenta. These "cord blood stem cells"
    are considered to be adult stem cells because they cannot
    generate all body cell types, just different types of blood
    cells. Therefore, adult stem cells and cord blood stem cells
    are pluripotent.</p>

    <h4>Stem Cells in Medicine</h4>

    <p>Stem cells are of great interest to researchers because of
    their ability to divide indefinitely, and to differentiate into
    many cell types. Stem cells have many existing or potential
    therapeutic applications. Such therapies include treatments for
    cancer, blood disorders, brain or spinal cord injuries, and
    blindness.</p>

      <p><strong>Figure</strong> 1.2</p>
    </div>

    <p>Embryonic stem cells, as shown in <strong role=
    "strong">Figure</strong> 1.2 <a href="#Bio35a-01-02-fig" id=
    "Bio35a-01-02-text" name="Bio35a-01-02-text">above</a>, are
    taken from eggs that were fertilized in the laboratory and
    donated to research. They may have the greatest potential
    because they are totipotent, and thus have the most potential
    medical applications. However, embryonic stem cells harvested
    from a donated embryo differ from a potential patient&rsquo;s
    tissue type. Therefore, just as in organ transplantation, there
    is a risk of a patient&rsquo;s body rejecting transplanted
    embryonic stem cells. Some individuals and groups have
    objections to the harvesting of embryonic stem cells, because
    harvesting the stem cells involves the destruction of the
    embryo. Some researchers are looking into methods to extract
    embryonic stem cells without destroying the actual embryo.
    Other researchers have claimed success in harvesting embryonic
    stem cells from the embryonic fluid that surrounds a growing
    fetus.</p>

    <p>Adult stem cells, including cord blood stem cells, have
    already been used to treat diseases of the blood such as
    sickle-cell anemia and certain types of cancer. Unlike
    embryonic stem cells, the use of adult stem cells in research
    and therapy is not controversial because the production of
    adult stem cells does not require the destruction of an embryo.
    Adult stem cells can be isolated from a tissue sample, such as
    bone marrow, from a person. Scientists have recently discovered
    more sources of adult stem cells in the body. Adult stem cells
    have been found in body fat, the inside lining of the nose, and
    in the brain. Some researchers are investigating ways to revert
    adult stem cells back to a totipotent stage.</p>

    <h3>Tissues</h3>

    <p>A <strong role="strong">tissue</strong> is a group of
    connected cells that have a similar function within an
    organism. The simplest living multicellular organisms, sponges,
    are made of many specialized types of cells that work together
    for a common goal. Such cell types include digestive cells,
    tubular pore cells, and epidermal cells. Though the different
    cell types create a large organized, multicellular
    structure&mdash;the visible sponge&mdash;they are not organized
    into true tissues. If a sponge is broken up by passing it
    through a sieve, the sponge will reform on the other side.</p>

    <p>More complex organisms such as jellyfish, coral, and sea
    anemones have a tissue level of organization. For example,
    jellyfish have tissues that have separate protective,
    digestive, and sensory functions. There are four basic types of
    tissue in the body of all animals, including the human body.
    These make up all the organs, structures and other contents of
    the body. <strong role="strong">Figure</strong> 1.3 <a href=
    "#Bio35a-1-n1-fig" id="Bio35a-1-n1-text" name=
    "Bio35a-1-n1-text">below</a> shows an example of each tissue
    type.</p>

    <p>The four basic types of tissue are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong role="strong">Epithelial tissue</strong> is made
      up of layers of tightly packed cells that line the surfaces
      of the body for protection, secretion, and absorption.
      Examples of epithelial tissue include the skin, the lining of
      the mouth and nose, and the lining of the digestive
      system.</li>

      <li><strong role="strong">Muscle tissue</strong> is made up
      of cells contain contractile filaments that move past each
      other and change the size of the cell. There are three types
      of muscle tissue: smooth muscle which is found in the inner
      linings of organs; skeletal muscle, which is attached to bone
      and moves the body; and cardiac muscle which is found only in
      the heart.</li>

      <li><strong role="strong">Nervous tissue</strong> is made up
      of the nerve cells (neurons) that together form the nervous
      system, including the brain and spinal cord.</li>

      <li><strong role="strong">Connective tissue</strong> is made
      up of many different types of cells that are all involved in
      structure and support of the body. Bone, blood, fat, and
      cartilage are all connective tissues. Connective tissue can
      be densely packed together, as bone cells are, or loosely
      packed, as adipose tissue (fat cells) are.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Organs and Organ Systems</h3>

    <p>Organs are the next level of organization in the body. An
    <strong role="strong">organ</strong> is a structure made of two
    or more tissues that work together for a common purpose. Skin,
    the largest organ in the body, is shown in <strong role=
    "strong">Figure</strong> 1.4 <a href="#Bio35a-01-04a-fig" id=
    "Bio35a-01-04a-text" name="Bio35a-01-04a-text">below</a>.
    Organs can be as primitive as the brain of a flatworm (a group
    of nerve cells), as large as the stem of a sequoia (up to 90
    meters in height (300 feet)), or as complex as a human liver.
    The human body has many different organs, such as the heart,
    the kidneys, the pancreas, and the skin. Two or all of the
    tissue types can be found in an organ. Organs inside the body
    are called internal organs. The internal organs collectively
    are often called viscera.</p>

    <div style=
    "float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class=
    "figure">
      <div><img src=
      "/flexr/api/ext/images?id=3007" width=
      "256px"></div>

      <p><a href="#Bio35a-01-04a-text" id="Bio35a-01-04a-fig" name=
      "Bio35a-01-04a-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p>

      <p><strong>Figure</strong> 1.4</p>
    </div>

    <p>The most complex organisms have organ systems. An
    <strong role="strong">organ system</strong> is a group of
    organs that act together to carry out complex interrelated
    functions, with each organ focusing on a part of the task. An
    example of an organ system is the human digestive system in
    which the mouth and esophagus ingests food, the stomach crushes
    and liquefies it, the pancreas and gall bladder make and
    release digestive enzymes, and the intestines absorb nutrients
    into the blood. An organ can be part of more than one organ
    system. For example the ovaries produce hormones which make
    them a part of the endocrine system. The ovaries also make eggs
    which makes them part of the reproductive system. One of the
    most important functions of organ systems is to provide cells
    with oxygen and nutrients and removes toxic waste products such
    as carbon dioxide. A number of organ systems, including the
    cardiovascular and respiratory systems, work together to do
    this.</p>

    <p>The different organ systems of the body are shown in
    <strong role="strong">Table</strong> 1.1 <a href=
    "#table:organ_systems_human_body-fig" id=
    "table:organ_systems_human_body-text" name=
    "table:organ_systems_human_body-text">below</a>. Sometimes the
    cardiovascular system and the lymphatic system are grouped
    together into one single system called the circulatory
    system.</p>

    <h3>Points to Consider</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>The smallest unit capable of carrying out life processes
      in your body is a single cell. Cells organize into tissues,
      which organize into organs. Groups of organs work together as
      organ systems. Consider how the last meal you consumed is
      interacting with each level of organization in your
      body.</li>

      <li>Think about the advantages and disadvantages of having a
      body composed of many small cells as opposed to a single
      large cell.</li>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>The human body is made up of trillions of cells that all
    work together for the maintenance of the entire organism. While
    cells, tissues, and organs may perform very different
    functions, all the cells in the body are similar in their
    metabolic needs. Maintaining a constant internal environment by
    providing the cells with what they need to survive (oxygen,
    nutrients, and removal of waste) is necessary for the
    well-being of individual cells and of the entire body. The many
    processes by which the body controls its internal environment
    are collectively called homeostasis. The complementary activity
    of major body systems maintains homeostasis.</p>

    <h3>Homeostasis</h3>

    <p><strong role="strong">Homeostasis</strong> refers to
    stability, balance, or equilibrium within a cell or the body.
    It is an organism&rsquo;s ability to keep a constant internal
    environment. Homeostasis is an important characteristic of
    living things. Keeping a stable internal environment requires
    constant adjustments as conditions change inside and outside
    the cell. The adjusting of systems within a cell is called
    homeostatic regulation. Because the internal and external
    environments of a cell are constantly changing, adjustments
    must be made continuously to stay at or near the set point (the
    normal level or range). Homeostasis can be thought of as a
    dynamic equilibrium rather than a constant, unchanging
    state.</p>

    <h4>Feedback Regulation Loops</h4>

    <p>The endocrine system plays an important role in homeostasis
    because hormones regulate the activity of body cells. The
    release of hormones into the blood is controlled by a stimulus.
    For example, the stimulus either causes an increase or a
    decrease in the amount of hormone secreted. Then, the response
    to a stimulus changes the internal conditions and may itself
    become a new stimulus. This self-adjusting mechanism is called
    feedback regulation.</p>

    <p>Feedback regulation occurs when the response to a stimulus
    has an effect of some kind on the original stimulus. The type
    of response determines what the feedback is called.
    <strong role="strong">Negative feedback</strong> occurs when
    the response to a stimulus reduces the original stimulus.
    <strong role="strong">Positive feedback</strong> occurs when
    the response to a stimulus increases the original stimulus.</p>

    <h4>Thermoregulation: A Negative Feedback Loop</h4>

    <p>Negative feedback is the most common feedback loop in
    biological systems. The system acts to reverse the direction of
    change. Since this tends to keep things constant, it allows the
    maintenance of homeostatic balance. For instance, when the
    concentration of carbon dioxide in the human body increases,
    the lungs are signaled to increase their activity and exhale
    more carbon dioxide, (your breathing rate increases).
    Thermoregulation is another example of negative feedback. When
    body temperature rises, receptors in the skin and the
    hypothalamus sense the temperature change. The temperature
    change (stimulus) triggers a command from the brain. This
    command, causes a response (the skin makes sweat and blood
    vessels near the skin surface dilate), which helps decrease
    body temperature. <strong role="strong">Figure</strong> 1.6
    <a href="#Bio35a-2-n1-fig" id="Bio35a-2-n1-text" name=
    "Bio35a-2-n1-text">below</a> shows how the response to a
    stimulus reduces the original stimulus in another of the
    body&rsquo;s negative feedback mechanisms.</p>

      <p><strong>Figure</strong> 1.6</p>
    </div>

    <p>Positive feedback is less common in biological systems.
    Positive feedback acts to speed up the direction of change. An
    example of positive feedback is lactation (milk production). As
    the baby suckles, nerve messages from the mammary glands cause
    the hormone prolactin, to be secreted by the pituitary gland.
    The more the baby suckles, the more prolactin is released,
    which stimulates further milk production.</p>

    <p>Not many feedback mechanisms in the body are based on
    positive feedback. Positive feedback speeds up the direction of
    change, which leads to increasing hormone concentration, a
    state that moves further away from homeostasis.</p>

    <h3>System Interactions</h3>

    <p>Each body system contributes to the homeostasis of other
    systems and of the entire organism. No system of the body works
    in isolation and the well-being of the person depends upon the
    well-being of all the interacting body systems. A disruption
    within one system generally has consequences for several
    additional body systems. Most of these organ systems are
    controlled by hormones secreted from the pituitary gland, a
    part of the endocrine system. <strong role=
    "strong">Table</strong> 1.2 <a href=

    "table:homeostatic_regulation_in_body-text">below</a>
    summarizes how various body systems work together to maintain
    homeostasis.</p>

    <p>Main examples of homeostasis in mammals are as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The regulation of the amounts of water and minerals in
      the body. This is known as osmoregulation. This happens
      primarily in the kidneys.</li>

      <li>The removal of metabolic waste. This is known as
      excretion. This is done by the excretory organs such as the
      kidneys and lungs.</li>

      <li>The regulation of body temperature. This is mainly done
      by the skin.</li>

      <li>The regulation of blood glucose level. This is mainly
      done by the liver and the insulin and glucagon secreted by
      the pancreas in the body.</li>

    <h4>Endocrine System</h4>

    <p>The endocrine system, shown in <strong role=
    "strong">Figure</strong> 1.7 <a href="#Bio35a-02-02-fig" id=
    "Bio35a-02-02-text" name="Bio35a-02-02-text">below</a>,
    includes glands which secrete hormones into the bloodstream.
    Hormones are chemical messenger molecules that are made by
    cells in one part of the body and cause changes in cells in
    another part of the body. The endocrine system regulates the
    metabolism and development of most body cells and body systems
    through feedback mechanisms. For example, Thyrotropin-Releasing
    Hormone (TRH) and Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) are
    controlled by a number of negative feedback mechanisms. The
    endocrine glands also release hormones that affect skin and
    hair color, appetite, and secondary sex characteristics of
    males and females.</p>

    <div style=
    "float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class=
    "figure">
      <div><img src=
      "/flexr/api/ext/images?id=3006" width=
      "256px"></div>

      <p><a href="#Bio35a-02-02-text" id="Bio35a-02-02-fig" name=
      "Bio35a-02-02-fig">[Back to Text]</a></p>

      <p><strong>Figure</strong> 1.7</p>
    </div>

    <p>The endocrine system has a regulatory effect on other organ
    systems in the human body. In the muscular system, hormones
    adjust muscle metabolism, energy production, and growth. In the
    nervous system, hormones affect neural metabolism, regulate
    fluid and ion concentration and help with reproductive hormones
    that influence brain development.</p>

    <h4>Urinary System</h4>

    <p>Toxic wastes build up in the blood as proteins and nucleic
    acids are broken down and used by the body. The urinary system
    rids the body of these wastes. The urinary system is also
    directly involved in maintaining proper blood volume. The
    kidneys also play an important role in maintaining the correct
    salt and water content of the body. External changes, such as a
    warm weather, that lead to excess fluid loss trigger feedback
    mechanisms that act to maintain the body's fluid content by
    inhibiting fluid loss. The kidneys also produce a hormone
    called erythropoietin, also known as EPO, which stimulates red
    blood cell production.</p>

    <h4>Reproductive System</h4>

    <p>The reproductive system does little for the homeostasis of
    the organism. The reproductive system relates instead to the
    maintenance of the species. However, sex hormones do have an
    effect on other body systems, and an imbalance in sex hormones
    can lead to various disorders. For example, a woman whose
    ovaries are removed early in life is at higher risk of
    developing osteoporosis, a disorder in which bones are thin and
    break easily. The hormone estrogen, produced by the ovaries, is
    important for bone growth. Therefore, a woman who does not
    produce estrogen will have impaired bone development.</p>

    <h3>Disruption of Homeostasis</h3>

    <p>Many homeostatic mechanisms keep the internal environment
    within certain limits (or set points). When the cells in your
    body do not work correctly, homeostatic balance is disrupted.
    Homeostatic imbalance may lead to a state of disease. Disease
    and cellular malfunction can be caused in two basic ways: by
    deficiency (cells not getting all they need) or toxicity (cells
    being poisoned by things they do not need). When homeostasis is
    interrupted, your body can correct or worsen the problem, based
    on certain influences. In addition to inherited (genetic)
    influences, there are external influences that are based on
    lifestyle choices and environmental exposure. These factors
    together influence the body's ability to maintain homeostatic
    balance. The endocrine system of a person with diabetes has
    difficulty maintaining the correct blood glucose level. A
    diabetic needs to check their blood glucose levels many times
    during the day, as shown in <strong role=
    "strong">Figure</strong> 1.8 <a href="#Bio35a2-03-fig" id=
    "Bio35a2-03-text" name="Bio35a2-03-text">below</a>, and monitor
    daily sugar intake.</p>

      <p><strong>Figure</strong> 1.8</p>

    <h4>Internal Influences: Heredity</h4>

    <p><strong role="strong">Genetics</strong>: Genes are sometimes
    turned off or on due to external factors which we have some
    control over. Other times, little can be done to prevent the
    development of certain genetic diseases and disorders. In such
    cases, medicines can help a person&rsquo;s body regain
    homeostasis. An example is the metabolic disorder Type 1
    diabetes, which is a disorder where the pancreas is no longer
    producing adequate amounts of insulin to respond to changes in
    a person's blood glucose level. Insulin replacement therapy, in
    conjunction with carbohydrate counting and careful monitoring
    of blood glucose concentration, is a way to bring the body's
    handling of glucose back into balance. Cancer can be
    genetically inherited or be due to a mutation caused by
    exposure to toxin such as radiation or harmful drugs. A person
    may also inherit a predisposition to develop a disease such as
    heart disease. Such diseases can be delayed or prevented if the
    person eats nutritious food, has regular physical activity, and
    does not smoke.</p>

    <h4>External Influences: Lifestyle</h4>

    <p><strong role="strong">Nutrition</strong>: If your diet lacks
    certain vitamins or minerals your cells will function poorly,
    and you may be at risk to develop a disease. For example, a
    menstruating woman with inadequate dietary intake of iron will
    become anemic. Hemoglobin, the molecule that enables red blood
    cells to transport oxygen, requires iron. Therefore, the blood
    of an anemic woman will have reduced oxygen-carrying capacity.
    In mild cases symptoms may be vague (e.g. fatigue), but if the
    anemia is severe the body will try to compensate by increasing
    cardiac output, leading to weakness, irregular heartbeats and
    in serious cases, heart failure.</p>

    <p><strong role="strong">Physical Activity</strong>: Physical
    activity is essential for proper functioning of our cells and
    bodies. Adequate rest and regular physical activity are
    examples of activities that influence homeostasis. Lack of
    sleep is related to a number of health problems such as
    irregular heartbeat, fatigue, anxiety, and headaches. Being
    overweight and obesity, two conditions that are related to poor
    nutrition and lack of physical activity greatly affect many
    organ systems and their homeostatic mechanisms. Being
    overweight or obese increases a person&rsquo;s risk of
    developing heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, and certain forms of
    cancer. Staying fit by regularly taking part in aerobic
    activities such as walking, shown in <strong role=
    "strong">Figure</strong> 1.9 <a href="#Bio35a2-04-fig" id=
    "Bio35a2-04-text" name="Bio35a2-04-text">below</a>, has been
    shown to help prevent many of these diseases.</p>

    <div style=
    "float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class=

      <div><img src=

      <p><strong>Figure</strong> 1.9</p>
    </div>

    <p><strong role="strong">Mental Health</strong>: Your physical
    health and mental health are inseparable. Our emotions cause
    chemical changes in our bodies that have various effects on our
    thoughts and feelings. Negative stress (also called distress)
    can negatively affect mental health. Regular physical activity
    has been shown to improve mental and physical wellbeing, and
    helps people to cope with distress. Among other things, regular
    physical activity increases the ability of the cardiovascular
    system to deliver oxygen to body cells, including the brain
    cells. Medications that may help balance the amount of certain
    mood-altering chemicals within the brain are often prescribed
    to people who have mental and mood disorders. This is an
    example of medical help in stabilizing a disruption in
    homeostasis.</p>

    <h4>Environmental Exposure</h4>

    <p>Any substance that interferes with cellular function and
    causes cellular malfunction is a cellular toxin. There are many
    different sources of toxins, for example, natural or synthetic
    drugs, plants, and animal bites. Air pollution, another form of
    environmental exposure to toxins is shown in <strong role=
    "strong">Figure</strong> 1.10 <a href="#Bio35a2-05-fig" id=
    "Bio35a2-05-text" name="Bio35a2-05-text">below</a>. A commonly
    seen example of an exposure to cellular toxins is by a drug
    overdose. When a person takes too much of a drug that affects
    the central nervous system, basic life functions such as
    breathing and heartbeat are disrupted. Such disruptions can
    results in coma, brain damage, and even death.</p>

    <div style=
    "float: left; clear: both; padding: 3em; width: 256px;" class=
    "figure">
      <div><img src=

    <p>The six factors described above have their effects at the
    cellular level. A deficiency or lack of beneficial pathways,
    whether caused by an internal or external influence, will
    almost always result in a harmful change in homeostasis. Too
    much toxicity also causes homeostatic imbalance, resulting in
    cellular malfunction. By removing negative health influences
    and providing adequate positive health influences, your body is
    better able to self-regulate and self-repair, which maintains
    homeostasis.</p>

    <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Homeostasis is an organism&rsquo;s ability to maintain a
      stable internal environment. Homeostasis is an important
      characteristic of living things. Keeping a stable internal
      environment requires constant adjustments as conditions
      change inside and outside the cell.</li>

      <li>Feedback regulation mechanisms are important to
      homeostasis. Feedback regulation occurs when the response to
      a stimulus has an effect of some kind on the original
      stimulus. The type of response (increase or decrease in the
      stimulus) determines what the feedback is called.</li>

      <li>Negative feedback occurs when the response to a stimulus
      reduces the original stimulus. Positive feedback occurs when
      the response to a stimulus increases the original
      stimulus.</li>

      <li>No system of the body works in isolation, and the
      well-being of a person depends upon the well-being of all the
      interacting body systems. A disruption within one system
      generally has consequences for several additional body
      systems.</li>

      <li>The homeostatic balance of most organs and organ systems
      is controlled by hormones secreted from the pituitary gland,
      a part of the endocrine system.</li>

      <li>When the cells in your body do not work correctly,
      homeostatic balance is disrupted. Homeostatic imbalance may
      lead to a state of disease. Type 2 diabetes is a disease in
      which homeostasis of the blood glucose level is disturbed,
      leading to an imbalance that affect many other body systems,
      including the cardiovascular system.</li>

    <dl>
      <dt>homeostasis</dt>

      <dd>Stability, balance, or equilibrium within the cell or a
      body; an organism&rsquo;s ability to keep a constant internal
      environment.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>negative feedback</dt>

      <dd>Occurs when the response to a stimulus reduces the
      original stimulus.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>positive feedback</dt>

      <dd>Occurs when the response to a stimulus increases the
      original stimulus.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Points to Consider</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Negative feedback is most common feedback loop in
      biological systems. The system acts to reverse the direction
      of change. Positive feedback is less common in biological
      systems. The system acts to speed up the direction of change.
      Consider how your social interactions with teachers, parents
      and other students may be classified as either positive or
      negative feedback.</li>

      <li>When homeostasis is interrupted, your body can correct or
      worsen the problem, based on certain influences. In addition
      to genetic influences, there are external influences that are
      based on lifestyle choices and environmental exposures.
      Describe how your lifestyle may positively or negatively
      affect your body's ability to maintain homeostasis</li>

      <caption>
        Control of blood glucose level is an example of negative
        feedback. Blood glucose concentration rises after a meal
        (the stimulus). The hormone insulin is released by the
        pancreas, and it speeds up the transport of glucose from
        the blood and into selected tissues (the response). Blood
        glucose concentrations then decrease, which then decreases
        the original stimulus. The secretion of insulin into the
        blood is then decreased.

        The endocrine system controls almost every other body
        system through feedback mechanisms. Most of the mechanisms
        of the endocrine system are negative feedback.
