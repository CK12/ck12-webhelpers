  <h2>The Big Idea</h2>

  <p>Light is a <em>wave</em> of changing electric and magnetic
  fields. Light waves are caused by disturbances in an
  electromagnetic field, like the acceleration of charged particles
  (such as electrons). Light has a dual nature; at times, it acts
  like waves, while at other times it acts like particles, called
  <em>photons</em>. Light travels through space at the maximum
  speed allowed by the laws of physics, called the speed of light.
  Light has no mass, but it carries energy and momentum. Fermat's
  principle states that <em>light will always take the path that
  takes the least amount of time</em> (not distance).</p>

  <p>Fermat&rsquo;s Principle governs the paths light will take and
  explains the familiar phenomena of reflection, refraction,
  diffraction, scattering and color absorption and dispersion.
  Light rarely travels in a straight line path. When photons
  interact with electrons in matter, the time it takes for this
  interaction determines the path. For example, higher frequency
  blue light is refracted more than red because blue interacts more
  frequently with electrons. Also, the path of least time is
  achieved when blue light bends more than red light so that it
  gets out of the 'slow' region faster. Fermat&rsquo;s Principle
  explains the many fascinating phenomena of light from rainbows to
  sunsets to the halos around the moon.</p>

  <h3>Key Concepts</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>When charged particles <em>accelerate</em>, changing
    electric and magnetic fields radiate outward. The traveling
    electric and magnetic fields of an accelerating (often
    oscillating) charged particle are known as electromagnetic
    radiation or light.</li>

    <li>The color of light that we observe is a measure of the
    frequency of the light: the <em>smaller</em> the frequency, the
    <em>redder</em> the light.</li>

    <li>The spectrum of electromagnetic radiation can be roughly
    broken into the following ranges:</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Light can have any wavelength. Our <em>vision</em> is
    restricted to a very narrow range of colors between red and
    violet.</li>

    <li>Fermat&rsquo;s Principle makes the angle of incident light
    equal to the angle of reflected light. This is the <em>law of
    reflection</em>.</li>

    <li>When light travels from one type of material (like air)
    into another (like glass), its effective speed is reduced due
    to interactions between photons and electrons. If the ray
    enters the material at an angle, Fermat&rsquo;s Principle
    dictates that the light will change the direction of its
    motion. One way to think about this is that light takes the
    path of least time to get from points A to point B, thus it
    takes a more direct path through &lsquo;slower&rsquo; mediums,
    so it can get out of the slow part faster. Light does not
    always travel in a straight line, it travels on the path of
    least time. This is called <em>refraction</em>.</li>

    <li>White light consists of a mixture of all the visible
    colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet
    (ROYGBIV). Our perception of the color black is tied to the
    <em>absence</em> of light.</li>

    <li>Different frequencies of light (and hence different colors
    in the visible spectrum) will travel at slightly different
    speeds in materials, like glass, and thus have slightly
    different refracting angles. This phenomena gives rise to
    rainbows.</li>

    <li>Our eyes include color-sensitive and brightness-sensitive
    cells. The three different color-sensitive cells (cones) can
    have sensitivity in three colors: red, blue, and green. Our
    perception of other colors is made from the <em>relative
    amounts</em> of each color that the cones register from light
    reflected from the object we are looking at. Our
    brightness-sensitive cells work well in low light. This is why
    things look &lsquo;black and white&rsquo; at night.</li>

    <li>The chemical bonds in pigments and dyes &ndash; like those
    in a colorful shirt &ndash; absorb light at frequencies that
    correspond to certain colors. When you shine white light on
    these pigments and dyes, some colors are absorbed and some
    colors are reflected. We only see the colors objects
    <em>reflect</em>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Key Applications</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Total internal reflection</em> occurs when light goes
    from a slow (high index of refraction) medium to a fast (low
    index of refraction) medium. With total internal reflection,
    light refracts so much it actually refracts back into the first
    medium. This is how fiber optic cables work: no light leaves
    the wire.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Rayleigh scattering</em> occurs when light interacts
    with our atmosphere. The shorter the wavelength of light, the
    more strongly it is disturbed by collisions with atmospheric
    molecules. Accordingly, blue light from the Sun is
    preferentially <em>scattered</em> by these collisions into our
    line of sight. This is why the sky appears blue.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Beautiful sunsets</em> are another manifestation of
    Rayleigh scattering that occurs when light travels long
    distances through the atmosphere. The blue light and some green
    is scattered away, making the sun appear red.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Lenses</em>, made from curved pieces of glass, focus or
    de-focus light as it passes through. Lenses that focus light
    are called <em>converging</em> lenses, and these are the ones
    used to make telescopes and cameras. Lenses that de-focus light
    are called <em>diverging</em> lenses.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><img src="/rpc/ck12/images?id=193" alt="" width="120px"></p>

  <p><img src="/rpc/ck12/images?id=192" alt="" width="120px"></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Lenses can be used to make visual representations, called
    <em>images</em>.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Mirrors</em> are made from highly reflective metal that
    is applied to a curved or flat piece of glass. Converging
    mirrors can be used to focus light &ndash; headlights,
    telescopes, satellite TV receivers, and solar cookers all rely
    on this principle. Like lenses, mirrors can create images.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>The <em>focal length</em>, <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
    "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=f" alt="f">, of a lens or mirror is the
    distance from the surface of the lens or mirror to the place
    where the light is focused. This is called the <em>focal
    point</em> or <em>focus</em>. For diverging lenses or mirrors,
    the focal length is negative.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>When light rays converge in front of a mirror or behind a
    lens, a <em>real</em> image is formed. Real images are useful
    in that you can place photographic film at the physical
    location of the real image, expose the film to the light, and
    make a two-dimensional representation of the world, a
    photograph.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>When light rays diverge in front of a mirror or behind a
    lens, a <em>virtual</em> image is formed. A virtual image is a
    trick, like the person you see &ldquo;behind&rdquo; a
    mirror&rsquo;s surface when you brush your teeth. Since virtual
    images aren&rsquo;t actually &ldquo;anywhere,&rdquo; you
    can&rsquo;t place photographic film anywhere to capture
    them.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Real images are upside-down, or <em>inverted</em>. You can
    make a real image of an object by putting it farther from a
    mirror or lens than the focal length. Virtual images are
    typically right-side-up. You can make virtual images by moving
    the mirror or lens closer to the object than the focal
    length.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Waves are characterized by their ability to constructively
    and destructively <em>interfere</em>. Light waves which
    interfere with themselves after interaction with a small
    aperture or target are said to <em>diffract</em>.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Light creates interference patterns when passing through
    holes (&ldquo;slits&rdquo;) in an obstruction such as paper or
    the surface of a CD, or when passing through a thin film such
    as soap.</li>
  </ul>

  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=3.0%5Cmathrm%7Bm%7D" alt="3.0\mathrm{m}">
  deep. She shines a laser at a height of <img class="x-ck12-math"
  src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=1.7%5Cmathrm%7Bm%7D" alt=
  "1.7\mathrm{m}"> that hits the water of the pool <img class=

  "8.1\mathrm{m}"> from the edge. Draw a diagram of this situation.
  Label all known lengths.</p>

  <p>a) How far from the edge of the pool will the light hit
  bottom?</p>

  <p>b) If her friend, Marc, were at the bottom and shined a light
  back, hitting the same spot as Nisha&rsquo;s, how far from the
  edge would he have to be so that the light never leaves the
  water?</p>

  <p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>

  <p>a) To solve for the distance from the edge we must first solve
  for the distance from the laser to the pool surface and then add
  that to the distance from the pool surface to the bottom of the
  pool. We can find the distance from the laser to the pool by
  using the Pythagorean Theorem. <img class="x-ck12-block-math"
  src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0Aa%5E2%2Bb%5E2%3Dc%5E2%20%5CRightarrow%20b%3D%5Csqrt%7Bc%5E2-a%5E2%7D%3D%7B8.1%5E2%5Cmathrm%7Bm%7D-1.7%5E2%5Cmathrm%7Bm%7D%7D%3D7.9%5Cmathrm%7Bm%7D%0A"
  alt=
  "a^2+b^2=c^2 \Rightarrow b=\sqrt{c^2-a^2}={8.1^2\mathrm{m}-1.7^2\mathrm{m}}=7.9\mathrm{m}">
  Now that we have the length from the laser to the pull all we
  need is the length from the surface of the pool to the bottom of
  it.</p>

  <p>To find this value we will use the equation <img class=
  "x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0An_a%5Ctimes%20sin%5Ctheta_a%3Dn_w%5Ctimes%20sin%5Ctheta_w%0A"
  alt="n_a\times sin\theta_a=n_w\times sin\theta_w"> Once we have
  solved for <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%5Ctheta_w" alt="\theta_w">, we will be able
  to use trigonometry to solve for the distance from the surface of
  the pool to the bottom of the pool. We know that <img class=
  "x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=n_a%3D1.00029" alt=
  "n_a=1.00029"> and that <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=n_w%3D1.33" alt="n_w=1.33">. So once we
  solve for <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%5Ctheta_a" alt="\theta_a">, we can solve
  for <img class="x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%5Ctheta_w"
  alt="\theta_w">. <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0Asin%5E%7B-1%7D%5Cfrac%7B1.7%7D%7B8.1%7D%3D12.1%5Eo%20%0A"
  alt="sin^{-1}\frac{1.7}{8.1}=12.1^o "> This is the complement of
  <img class="x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%5Ctheta_a"
  alt="\theta_a">, so <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0A90%5Eo-12.1%5Eo%3D77.9%5Eo%0A" alt=
  "90^o-12.1^o=77.9^o"> Now we can solve for <img class=
  "x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%5Ctheta_w" alt=
  "\theta_w">. <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0An_a%5Ctimes%20sin%5Ctheta_a%3Dn_w%5Ctimes%20sin%5Ctheta_w%20%5CRightarrow%20%5Ctheta_w%3Dsin%5E%7B-1%7D%28%5Cfrac%7Bn_a%5Ctimes%20sin%5Ctheta_a%7D%7Bn_w%7D%29%3Dsin%5E%7B-1%7D%28%5Cfrac%7B1.00029%5Ctimes%20.98%7D%7B1.33%7D%29%3D47.5%5Eo%0A"
  alt=
  "n_a\times sin\theta_a=n_w\times sin\theta_w \Rightarrow \theta_w=sin^{-1}(\frac{n_a\times sin\theta_a}{n_w})=sin^{-1}(\frac{1.00029\times .98}{1.33})=47.5^o"></p>

  <p>Now we can use trigonometry. <img class="x-ck12-block-math"
  src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0Atan%5Ctheta%3D%5Cfrac%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bopposite%7D%7D%7B%5Cmathrm%7Badjacent%7D%7D%20%5CRightarrow%20%5Cmathrm%7Bopposite%7D%3D%5Cmathrm%7Badjacent%7D%5Ctimes%20tan%5Ctheta%20%3D3%5Cmathrm%7Bm%7D%5Ctimes%20tan47.5%5Eo%3D3.3%5Cmathrm%7Bm%7D%0A"
  alt=
  "tan\theta=\frac{\mathrm{opposite}}{\mathrm{adjacent}} \Rightarrow \mathrm{opposite}=\mathrm{adjacent}\times tan\theta =3\mathrm{m}\times tan47.5^o=3.3\mathrm{m}"></p>

  <p>Now we simply need to add the two distances together to get
  our answer. <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0A3.3%5Cmathrm%7Bm%7D%2B7.9%5Cmathrm%7Bm%7D%3D11.2%5Cmathrm%7Bm%7D%0A"
  alt="3.3\mathrm{m}+7.9\mathrm{m}=11.2\mathrm{m}"></p>

  <p>b) For the beam of light to never leave the water, <img class=
  "x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=sin%5E%7B-1%7D%5Ctheta_a%3D90" alt=
  "sin^{-1}\theta_a=90">. For this to be true, <img class=
  "x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%5Ctheta_a%3D1" alt=
  "\theta_a=1">. So, we will use following equation and then
  substitute <img class="x-ck12-math" src="/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=1"
  alt="1"> for <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%5Ctheta_a" alt="\theta_a">. This will allow
  us to solve for <img class="x-ck12-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?math=%5Ctheta_w" alt="\theta_w"> which will, in
  turn, allow for us to solve for James' distance from the edge of
  the pool. <img class="x-ck12-block-math" src=
  "/rpc/ck12/ucs/?blockmath=%0An_a%5Ctimes%20sin%5Ctheta_a%3Dn_w%5Ctimes%20sin%5Ctheta_w%20%5CRightarrow%20n_a%5Ctimes%201%3Dn_w%5Ctimes%20sin%5Ctheta_w%20%5CRightarrow%20%5Ctheta_w%3Dsin%5E%7B-1%7D%28%5Cfrac%7Bn_a%7D%7Bn_w%7D%29%3Dsin%5E%7B-1%7D%28%5Cfrac%7B1.00029%7D%7B1.33%7D%29%3D48.8%5Eo%0A"
  alt=

  <p>Now we can use trigonometry to get our answer. <img class=
  "x-ck12-block-math" src=
