Dear {{ member.fix().name }},

Thank you for registering with CK-12's FlexBook System. We're sure you're eager to explore our excellent resources. Here are a few tips to help:

    *  Our content is divided into concepts and books. Concepts are great for learning or reviewing specific topics. Books provide in-depth details about a subject.
    *  Concepts and books can be edited to best match a teacher or learners needs.

Just confirm from <a href="{{ events.0.eventData }}" target="_blank">here</a>. Enjoy these great resources!

If you did not provide your email to CK-12 or if you have any other questions, please email support@ck12.org.

Sincerely,
The CK-12 Team
