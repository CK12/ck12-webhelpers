Dear {{ member.fix().name }},

Thank you for registering with CK-12's FlexBook System. We're sure you're eager to explore our excellent resources. Here are a few tips to help:


    * Our content is divided into concepts and books. Concepts are great for learning or reviewing specific topics. Books provide in-depth details about a subject.
    * Concepts and books can be edited to best match a teacher or learners needs.
    * Please direct any questions or feedback to support@ck12.org. 


Just get started from <a href="{{ site }}" target="_blank">here</a>. Enjoy these great resources!

Sincerely,

The CK-12 Team
