"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.B.2.6",,"Carbon atoms can bond to one another in chains, rings, and branching networks to form a variety of structures, including synthetic polymers, oils, and the large molecules essential to life."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.B.3.1",,"Chemical reactions occur all around us, for example in health care, cooking, cosmetics, and automobiles. Complex chemical reactions involving carbon-based molecules take place constantly in every cell in our bodies. [See Content Standard C (grades 9-12) ]"
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.B.3.2",,"Chemical reactions may release or consume energy. Some reactions such as the burning of fossil fuels release large amounts of energy by losing heat and by emitting light. Light can initiate many chemical reactions such as photosynthesis and the evolution of urban smog."

"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.B.6.4",,
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.C.1.1",,"Cells have particular structures that underlie their functions. Every cell is surrounded by a membrane that separates it from the outside world. Inside the cell is a concentrated mixture of thousands of different molecules which form a variety of specialized structures that carry out such cell functions as energy production, transport of molecules, waste disposal, synthesis of new molecules, and the storage of genetic material. [See Unifying Concepts and Processes]"
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.C.1.2",,"Most cell functions involve chemical reactions. Food molecules taken into cells react to provide the chemical constituents needed to synthesize other molecules. Both breakdown and synthesis are made possible by a large set of protein catalysts, called enzymes. The breakdown of some of the food molecules enables the cell to store energy in specific chemicals that are used to carry out the many functions of the cell."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.C.1.3",,"Cells store and use information to guide their functions. The genetic information stored in DNA is used to direct the synthesis of the thousands of proteins that each cell requires."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.C.1.4",,"Cell functions are regulated. Regulation occurs both through changes in the activity of the functions performed by proteins and through the selective expression of individual genes. This regulation allows cells to respond to their environment and to control and coordinate cell growth and division."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.C.1.5",,"Plant cells contain chloroplasts, the site of photosynthesis. Plants and many microorganisms use solar energy to combine molecules of carbon dioxide and water into complex, energy rich organic compounds and release oxygen to the environment. This process of photosynthesis provides a vital connection between the sun and the energy needs of living systems."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.C.1.6",,"Cells can differentiate, and complex multicellular organisms are formed as a highly organized arrangement of differentiated cells. In the development of these multicellular organisms, the progeny from a single cell form an embryo in which the cells multiply and differentiate to form the many specialized cells, tissues and organs that comprise the final organism. This differentiation is regulated through the expression of different genes."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.C.2.1",,"In all organisms, the instructions for specifying the characteristics of the organism are carried in DNA, a large polymer formed from subunits of four kinds (A, G, C, and T). The chemical and structural properties of DNA explain how the genetic information that underlies heredity is both encoded in genes (as a string of molecular ""letters"") and replicated (by a templating mechanism). Each DNA molecule in a cell forms a single chromosome. [See Content Standard B (grades 9-12)]"
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.C.2.2",,"Most of the cells in a human contain two copies of each of 22 different chromosomes. In addition, there is a pair of chromosomes that determines sex: a female contains two X chromosomes and a male contains one X and one Y chromosome. Transmission of genetic information to offspring occurs through egg and sperm cells that contain only one representative from each chromosome pair. An egg and a sperm unite to form a new individual. The fact that the human body is formed from cells that contain two copies of each chromosome--and therefore two copies of each gene--explains many features of human heredity, such as how variations that are hidden in one generation can be expressed in the next."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.C.2.3",,"Changes in DNA (mutations) occur spontaneously at low rates. Some of these changes make no difference to the organism, whereas others can change cells and organisms. Only mutations in germ cells can create the variation that changes an organism's offspring."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.C.3.1",,"Species evolve over time. Evolution is the consequence of the interactions of (1) the potential for a species to increase its numbers, (2) the genetic variability of offspring due to mutation and recombination of genes, (3) a finite supply of the resources required for life, and (4) the ensuing selection by the environment of those offspring better able to survive and leave offspring. [See Unifying Concepts and Processes]"
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.C.3.2",,"The great diversity of organisms is the result of more than 3.5 billion years of evolution that has filled every available niche with life forms."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.C.3.3",,"Natural selection and its evolutionary consequences provide a scientific explanation for the fossil record of ancient life forms, as well as for the striking molecular similarities observed among the diverse species of living organisms."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.C.3.4",,"The millions of different species of plants, animals, and microorganisms that live on earth today are related by descent from common ancestors."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.C.3.5",,"Biological classifications are based on how organisms are related. Organisms are classified into a hierarchy of groups and subgroups based on similarities which reflect their evolutionary relationships. Species is the most fundamental unit of classification."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.C.4.1",,"The atoms and molecules on the earth cycle among the living and nonliving components of the biosphere."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.C.4.2",,"Energy flows through ecosystems in one direction, from photosynthetic organisms to herbivores to carnivores and decomposers."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.C.4.3",,"Organisms both cooperate and compete in ecosystems. The interrelationships and interdependencies of these organisms may generate ecosystems that are stable for hundreds or thousands of years."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.C.4.4",,"Living organisms have the capacity to produce populations of infinite size, but environments and resources are finite. This fundamental tension has profound effects on the interactions between organisms."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.C.4.5",,"Human beings live within the world's ecosystems. Increasingly, humans modify ecosystems as a result of population growth, technology, and consumption. Human destruction of habitats through direct harvesting, pollution, atmospheric changes, and other factors is threatening current global stability, and if not addressed, ecosystems will be irreversibly affected."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.C.5.1",,"All matter tends toward more disorganized states. Living systems require a continuous input of energy to maintain their chemical and physical organizations. With death, and the cessation of energy input, living systems rapidly disintegrate. [See Unifying Concepts and Processes]"
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.C.5.2",,"The energy for life primarily derives from the sun. Plants capture energy by absorbing light and using it to form strong (covalent) chemical bonds between the atoms of carbon-containing (organic) molecules. These molecules can be used to assemble larger molecules with biological activity (including proteins, DNA, sugars, and fats). In addition, the energy stored in bonds between the atoms (chemical energy) can be used as sources of energy for life processes."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.C.5.3",,"The chemical bonds of food molecules contain energy. Energy is released when the bonds of food molecules are broken and new compounds with lower energy bonds are formed. Cells usually store this energy temporarily in phosphate bonds of a small high-energy compound called ATP."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.C.5.4",,"The complexity and organization of organisms accommodates the need for obtaining, transforming, transporting, releasing, and eliminating the matter and energy used to sustain the organism."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.C.5.5",,"The distribution and abundance of organisms and populations in ecosystems are limited by the availability of matter and energy and the ability of the ecosystem to recycle materials."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.C.5.6",,"As matter and energy flows through different levels of organization of living systems--cells, organs, organisms, communities--and between living systems and the physical environment, chemical elements are recombined in different ways. Each recombination results in storage and dissipation of energy into the environment as heat. Matter and energy are conserved in each change."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.C.6.1",,"Multicellular animals have nervous systems that generate behavior. Nervous systems are formed from specialized cells that conduct signals rapidly through the long cell extensions that make up nerves. The nerve cells communicate with each other by secreting specific excitatory and inhibitory molecules. In sense organs, specialized cells detect light, sound, and specific chemicals and enable animals to monitor what is going on in the world around them."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.C.6.2",,"Organisms have behavioral responses to internal changes and to external stimuli. Responses to external stimuli can result from interactions with the organism's own species and others, as well as environmental changes; these responses either can be innate or learned. The broad patterns of behavior exhibited by animals have evolved to ensure reproductive success. Animals often live in unpredictable environments, and so their behavior must be flexible enough to deal with uncertainty and change. Plants also respond to stimuli."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.C.6.3",,"Like other aspects of an organism's biology, behaviors have evolved through natural selection. Behaviors often have an adaptive logic when viewed in terms of evolutionary principles."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.C.6.4",,"Behavioral biology has implications for humans, as it provides links to psychology, sociology, and anthropology."

"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.D.2.1",,"The earth is a system containing essentially a fixed amount of each stable chemical atom or element. Each element can exist in several different chemical reservoirs. Each element on earth moves among reservoirs in the solid earth, oceans, atmosphere, and organisms as part of geochemical cycles."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.D.2.2",,"Movement of matter between reservoirs is driven by the earth's internal and external sources of energy. These movements are often accompanied by a change in the physical and chemical properties of the matter. Carbon, for example, occurs in carbonate rocks such as limestone, in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide gas, in water as dissolved carbon dioxide, and in all organisms as complex molecules that control the chemistry of life."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.D.3.1",,
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.D.3.2",,"Geologic time can be estimated by observing rock sequences and using fossils to correlate the sequences at various locations. Current methods include using the known decay rates of radioactive isotopes present in rocks to measure the time since the rock was formed."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.D.3.3",,
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.D.3.4",,"Evidence for one-celled forms of life--the bacteria--extends back more than 3.5 billion years. The evolution of life caused dramatic changes in the composition of the earth's atmosphere, which did not originally contain oxygen."

"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.E.2.3",,"Creativity, imagination, and a good knowledge base are all required in the work of science and engineering."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.E.2.4",,"Science and technology are pursued for different purposes."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.E.2.5",,"Technological knowledge is often not made public because of patents and the financial potential of the idea or invention. Scientific knowledge is made public."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.F.1.1",,"Hazards and the potential for accidents exist. Regardless of the environment, the possibility of injury, illness, disability, or death may be present. Humans have a variety of mechanisms--sensory, motor, emotional, social, and technological--that can reduce and modify hazards. [See Content Standard C (grades 9-12) ]"
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.F.1.2",,"The severity of disease symptoms is dependent on many factors, such as human resistance and the virulence of the disease-producing organism. Many diseases can be prevented, controlled, or cured. Some diseases, such as cancer, result from specific body dysfunctions and cannot be transmitted."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.F.1.3",,"Personal choice concerning fitness and health involves multiple factors. Personal goals, peer and social pressures, ethnic and religious beliefs, and understanding of biological consequences can all influence decisions about health practices."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.F.1.4",,"An individual's mood and behavior may be modified by substances. The modification may be beneficial or detrimental depending on the motives, type of substance, duration of use, pattern of use, level of influence, and short- and long-term effects. Students should understand that drugs can result in physical dependence and can increase the risk of injury, accidents, and death."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.F.1.5",,"Selection of foods and eating patterns determine nutritional balance. Nutritional balance has a direct effect on growth and development and personal well-being. Personal and social factors--such as habits, family income, ethnic heritage, body size, advertising, and peer pressure--influence nutritional choices."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.F.1.6",,"Families serve basic health needs, especially for young children. Regardless of the family structure, individuals have families that involve a variety of physical, mental, and social relationships that influence the maintenance and improvement of health."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.F.1.7",,"Sexuality is basic to the physical, mental, and social development of humans. Students should understand that human sexuality involves biological functions, psychological motives, and cultural, ethnic, religious, and technological influences. Sex is a basic and powerful force that has consequences to individuals' health and to society. Students should understand various methods of controlling the reproduction process and that each method has a different type of effectiveness and different health and social consequences."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.F.2.1",,"Populations grow or decline through the combined effects of births and deaths, and through emigration and immigration. Populations can increase through linear or exponential growth, with effects on resource use and environmental pollution."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.F.2.2",,"Various factors influence birth rates and fertility rates, such as average levels of affluence and education, importance of children in the labor force, education and employment of women, infant mortality rates, costs of raising children, availability and reliability of birth control methods, and religious beliefs and cultural norms that influence personal decisions about family size."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.F.2.3",,"Populations can reach limits to growth. Carrying capacity is the maximum number of individuals that can be supported in a given environment. The limitation is not the availability of space, but the number of people in relation to resources and the capacity of earth systems to support human beings. Changes in technology can cause significant changes, either positive or negative, in carrying capacity."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.F.3.1",,"Human populations use resources in the environment in order to maintain and improve their existence. Natural resources have been and will continue to be used to maintain human populations."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.F.3.2",,"The earth does not have infinite resources; increasing human consumption places severe stress on the natural processes that renew some resources, and it depletes those resources that cannot be renewed."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.F.3.3",,"Humans use many natural systems as resources. Natural systems have the capacity to reuse waste, but that capacity is limited. Natural systems can change to an extent that exceeds the limits of organisms to adapt naturally or humans to adapt technologically."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.F.4.1",,"Natural ecosystems provide an array of basic processes that affect humans. Those processes include maintenance of the quality of the atmosphere, generation of soils, control of the hydrologic cycle, disposal of wastes, and recycling of nutrients. Humans are changing many of these basic processes, and the changes may be detrimental to humans. [See Content Standard C (grades 9-12) ]"
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.F.4.2",,"Materials from human societies affect both physical and chemical cycles of the earth."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.F.4.3",,"Many factors influence environmental quality. Factors that students might investigate include population growth, resource use, population distribution, overconsumption, the capacity of technology to solve problems, poverty, the role of economic, political, and religious views, and different ways humans view the earth."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.F.5.1",,"Normal adjustments of earth may be hazardous for humans. Humans live at the interface between the atmosphere driven by solar energy and the upper mantle where convection creates changes in the earth's solid crust. As societies have grown, become stable, and come to value aspects of the environment, vulnerability to natural processes of change has increased. [See Content Standard D (grades 9-12)]"
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.F.5.2",,"Human activities can enhance potential for hazards. Acquisition of resources, urban growth, and waste disposal can accelerate rates of natural change."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.F.5.3",,"Some hazards, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and severe weather, are rapid and spectacular. But there are slow and progressive changes that also result in problems for individuals and societies. For example, change in stream channel position, erosion of bridge foundations, sedimentation in lakes and harbors, coastal erosions, and continuing erosion and wasting of soil and landscapes can all negatively affect society."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.F.5.4",,"Natural and human-induced hazards present the need for humans to assess potential danger and risk. Many changes in the environment designed by humans bring benefits to society, as well as cause risks. Students should understand the costs and trade-offs of various hazards--ranging from those with minor risk to a few people to major catastrophes with major risk to many people. The scale of events and the accuracy with which scientists and engineers can (and cannot) predict events are important considerations."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.F.6.1",,"Science and technology are essential social enterprises, but alone they can only indicate what can happen, not what should happen. The latter involves human decisions about the use of knowledge. [See Content Standard E (grades 9-12) ]"
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.F.6.2",,"Understanding basic concepts and principles of science and technology should precede active debate about the economics, policies, politics, and ethics of various science- and technology-related challenges. However, understanding science alone will not resolve local, national, or global challenges."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.F.6.3",,"Progress in science and technology can be affected by social issues and challenges. Funding priorities for specific health problems serve as examples of ways that social issues influence science and technology."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.F.6.4",,"Individuals and society must decide on proposals involving new research and the introduction of new technologies into society. Decisions involve assessment of alternatives, risks, costs, and benefits and consideration of who benefits and who suffers, who pays and gains, and what the risks are and who bears them. Students should understand the appropriateness and value of basic questions--""What can happen?""--""What are the odds?""--and ""How do scientists and engineers know what will happen?"""
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.F.6.5",,"Humans have a major effect on other species. For example, the influence of humans on other organisms occurs through land use--which decreases space available to other species--and pollution--which changes the chemical composition of air, soil, and water."

"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.G.1.2",,"Scientists have ethical traditions."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.G.1.3",,"Scientists are influenced by societal, cultural, and personal beliefs and ways of viewing the world."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.G.2.1",,"Science distinguishes itself from other ways of knowing and from other bodies of knowledge."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.G.2.2",,"Scientific explanations must meet certain criteria."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.G.2.3",,"Because all scientific ideas depend on experimental and observational confirmation, all scientific knowledge is, in principle, subject to change as new evidence becomes available."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.G.3.1",,"In history, diverse cultures have contributed scientific knowledge and technologic inventions. Usually, changes in science occur as small modifications in extant knowledge."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.G.3.2",,"Occasionally, there are advances in science and technology that have important and long-lasting effects on science and society."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.BIO.G.3.3",,"The historical perceptive of scientific explanations demonstrates how scientific knowledge changes by evolving over time, almost always building on earlier knowledge."
