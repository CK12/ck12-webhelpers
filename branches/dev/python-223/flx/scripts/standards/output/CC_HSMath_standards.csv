"MAT.CC.9-12.S.CP.5","Recognize and explain the concepts of conditional probability and independence in everyday language and everyday situations."
"MAT.CC.9-12.S.CP.6","Find the conditional probability of A given B as the fraction of B’s outcomes that also belong to A, and interpret the answer in terms of the model."
"MAT.CC.9-12.S.CP.7","Apply the Addition Rule, P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) – P(A and B), and interpret the answer in terms of the model."
"MAT.CC.9-12.S.CP.8","Apply the general Multiplication Rule in a uniform probability model, P(A and B) = P(A)P(B|A) = P(B)P(A|B), and interpret the answer in terms of the model."
"MAT.CC.9-12.S.CP.9","Use permutations and combinations to compute probabilities of compound events and solve problems."
"MAT.CC.9-12.S.MD.1","Define a random variable for a quantity of interest by assigning a numerical value to each event in a sample space; graph the corresponding probability distribution using the same graphical displays as for data distributions."
"MAT.CC.9-12.S.MD.2","Calculate the expected value of a random variable; interpret it as the mean of the probability distribution."
"MAT.CC.9-12.S.MD.3","Develop a probability distribution for a random variable defined for a sample space in which theoretical probabilities can be calculated; find the expected value."
"MAT.CC.9-12.S.MD.4","Develop a probability distribution for a random variable defined for a sample space in which probabilities are assigned empirically; find the expected value."
"MAT.CC.9-12.S.MD.5","Weigh the possible outcomes of a decision by assigning probabilities to payoff values and finding expected values."
"MAT.CC.9-12.S.MD.5.a","Find the expected payoff for a game of chance."
"MAT.CC.9-12.S.MD.5.b","Evaluate and compare strategies on the basis of expected values."
"MAT.CC.9-12.S.MD.6","Use probabilities to make fair decisions (e.g., drawing by lots, using a random number generator)."
"MAT.CC.9-12.S.MD.7","Analyze decisions and strategies using probability concepts (e.g., product testing, medical testing, pulling a hockey goalie at the end of a game)."
"MAT.CC.9-12.M.CO.1","Modeling is best interpreted not as a collection of isolated topics but rather in relation to other standards. Making mathematical models is a Standard for Mathematical Practice, and specific modeling standards appear throughout the original Common Core high school standards indicated by a star symbol (★)."
"MAT.CC.9-12.RP.1","Topics considered prerequisite to Common Core for high school, correlated here as opportunities to review middle school topics in preparation for new instruction and challenging applications to come."
