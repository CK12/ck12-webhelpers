"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.A.1.5",,"Recognize and analyze alternative explanations and models."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.A.1.6",,"Communicate and defend a scientific argument."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.A.2.1",,"Scientists usually inquire about how physical, living, or designed systems function."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.A.2.2",,"Scientists conduct investigations for a wide variety of reasons."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.A.2.3",,"Scientists rely on technology to enhance the gathering and manipulation of data."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.A.2.4",,"Mathematics is essential in scientific inquiry."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.A.2.5",,"Scientific explanations must adhere to criteria such as a proposed explanation must be logically consistent; it must abide by the rules of evidence; it must be open to questions and possible modification; and it must be based on historical and current scientific knowledge."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.A.2.6",,"Results of scientific inquiry emerge from different types of investigations and public communication among scientists."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.B.1.1",,"Matter is made of minute particles called atoms, and atoms are composed of even smaller components. These components have measurable properties, such as mass and electrical charge. Each atom has a positively charged nucleus surrounded by negatively charged electrons. The electric force between the nucleus and electrons holds the atom together."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.B.1.2",,"The atom's nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons, which are much more massive than electrons. When an element has atoms that differ in the number of neutrons, these atoms are called different isotopes of the element."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.B.1.3",,"The nuclear forces that hold the nucleus of an atom together, at nuclear distances, are usually stronger than the electric forces that would make it fly apart. Nuclear reactions convert a fraction of the mass of interacting particles into energy, and they can release much greater amounts of energy than atomic interactions. Fission is the splitting of a large nucleus into smaller pieces. Fusion is the joining of two nuclei at extremely high temperature and pressure, and is the process responsible for the energy of the sun and other stars."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.B.1.4",,"Radioactive isotopes are unstable and undergo spontaneous nuclear reactions, emitting particles and/or wavelike radiation. The decay of any one nucleus cannot be predicted, but a large group of identical nuclei decay at a predictable rate. This predictability can be used to estimate the age of materials that contain radioactive isotopes."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.B.2.1",,"Atoms interact with one another by transferring or sharing electrons that are furthest from the nucleus. These outer electrons govern the chemical properties of the element."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.B.2.2",,"An element is composed of a single type of atom. When elements are listed in order according to the number of protons (called the atomic number), repeating patterns of physical and chemical properties identify families of elements with similar properties. This ""Periodic Table"" is a consequence of the repeating pattern of outermost electrons and their permitted energies."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.B.2.3",,"Bonds between atoms are created when electrons are paired up by being transferred or shared. A substance composed of a single kind of atom is called an element. The atoms may be bonded together into molecules or crystalline solids. A compound is formed when two or more kinds of atoms bind together chemically."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.B.2.4",,"The physical properties of compounds reflect the nature of the interactions among its molecules. These interactions are determined by the structure of the molecule, including the constituent atoms and the distances and angles between them."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.B.2.5",,"Solids, liquids, and gases differ in the distances and angles between molecules or atoms and therefore the energy that binds them together. In solids the structure is nearly rigid; in liquids molecules or atoms move around each other but do not move apart; and in gases molecules or atoms move almost independently of each other and are mostly far apart."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.B.2.6",,"Carbon atoms can bond to one another in chains, rings, and branching networks to form a variety of structures, including synthetic polymers, oils, and the large molecules essential to life."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.B.3.1",,"Chemical reactions occur all around us, for example in health care, cooking, cosmetics, and automobiles. Complex chemical reactions involving carbon-based molecules take place constantly in every cell in our bodies. [See Content Standard C (grades 9-12) ]"
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.B.3.2",,"Chemical reactions may release or consume energy. Some reactions such as the burning of fossil fuels release large amounts of energy by losing heat and by emitting light. Light can initiate many chemical reactions such as photosynthesis and the evolution of urban smog."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.B.3.3",,"A large number of important reactions involve the transfer of either electrons (oxidation/reduction reactions) or hydrogen ions (acid/base reactions) between reacting ions, molecules, or atoms. In other reactions, chemical bonds are broken by heat or light to form very reactive radicals with electrons ready to form new bonds. Radical reactions control many processes such as the presence of ozone and greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, burning and processing of fossil fuels, the formation of polymers, and explosions."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.B.3.4",,"Chemical reactions can take place in time periods ranging from the few femtoseconds (10-15 seconds) required for an atom to move a fraction of a chemical bond distance to geologic time scales of billions of years. Reaction rates depend on how often the reacting atoms and molecules encounter one another, on the temperature, and on the properties--including shape--of the reacting species."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.B.3.5",,"Catalysts, such as metal surfaces, accelerate chemical reactions. Chemical reactions in living systems are catalyzed by protein molecules called enzymes."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.B.4.1",,"Objects change their motion only when a net force is applied. Laws of motion are used to calculate precisely the effects of forces on the motion of objects. The magnitude of the change in motion can be calculated using the relationship F = ma, which is independent of the nature of the force. Whenever one object exerts force on another, a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction is exerted on the first object."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.B.4.2",,"Gravitation is a universal force that each mass exerts on any other mass. The strength of the gravitational attractive force between two masses is proportional to the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.B.4.3",,"The electric force is a universal force that exists between any two charged objects. Opposite charges attract while like charges repel. The strength of the force is proportional to the charges, and, as with gravitation, inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.B.4.4",,"Between any two charged particles, electric force is vastly greater than the gravitational force. Most observable forces such as those exerted by a coiled spring or friction may be traced to electric forces acting between atoms and molecules."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.B.4.5",,"Electricity and magnetism are two aspects of a single electromagnetic force. Moving electric charges produce magnetic forces, and moving magnets produce electric forces. These effects help students to understand electric motors and generators."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.B.5.1",,"The total energy of the universe is constant. Energy can be transferred by collisions in chemical and nuclear reactions, by light waves and other radiations, and in many other ways. However, it can never be destroyed. As these transfers occur, the matter involved becomes steadily less ordered. [See Content Standard C (grades 9-12)]"
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.B.5.2",,"All energy can be considered to be either kinetic energy, which is the energy of motion; potential energy, which depends on relative position; or energy contained by a field, such as electromagnetic waves."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.B.5.3",,"Heat consists of random motion and the vibrations of atoms, molecules, and ions. The higher the temperature, the greater the atomic or molecular motion."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.B.5.4",,"Everything tends to become less organized and less orderly over time. Thus, in all energy transfers, the overall effect is that the energy is spread out uniformly. Examples are the transfer of energy from hotter to cooler objects by conduction, radiation, or convection and the warming of our surroundings when we burn fuels."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.B.6.1",,"Waves, including sound and seismic waves, waves on water, and light waves, have energy and can transfer energy when they interact with matter. [See Content Standard D (grades 9-12) ]"
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.B.6.2",,"Electromagnetic waves result when a charged object is accelerated or decelerated. Electromagnetic waves include radio waves (the longest wavelength), microwaves, infrared radiation (radiant heat), visible light, ultraviolet radiation, x-rays, and gamma rays. The energy of electromagnetic waves is carried in packets whose magnitude is inversely proportional to the wavelength."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.B.6.3",,"Each kind of atom or molecule can gain or lose energy only in particular discrete amounts and thus can absorb and emit light only at wavelengths corresponding to these amounts. These wavelengths can be used to identify the substance."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.B.6.4",,"In some materials, such as metals, electrons flow easily, whereas in insulating materials such as glass they can hardly flow at all. Semiconducting materials have intermediate behavior. At low temperatures some materials become superconductors and offer no resistance to the flow of electrons."

"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.E.2.5",,"Technological knowledge is often not made public because of patents and the financial potential of the idea or invention. Scientific knowledge is made public."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.F.1.1",,"Hazards and the potential for accidents exist. Regardless of the environment, the possibility of injury, illness, disability, or death may be present. Humans have a variety of mechanisms--sensory, motor, emotional, social, and technological--that can reduce and modify hazards. [See Content Standard C (grades 9-12) ]"
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.F.1.2",,"The severity of disease symptoms is dependent on many factors, such as human resistance and the virulence of the disease-producing organism. Many diseases can be prevented, controlled, or cured. Some diseases, such as cancer, result from specific body dysfunctions and cannot be transmitted."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.F.1.3",,"Personal choice concerning fitness and health involves multiple factors. Personal goals, peer and social pressures, ethnic and religious beliefs, and understanding of biological consequences can all influence decisions about health practices."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.F.1.4",,"An individual's mood and behavior may be modified by substances. The modification may be beneficial or detrimental depending on the motives, type of substance, duration of use, pattern of use, level of influence, and short- and long-term effects. Students should understand that drugs can result in physical dependence and can increase the risk of injury, accidents, and death."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.F.1.5",,"Selection of foods and eating patterns determine nutritional balance. Nutritional balance has a direct effect on growth and development and personal well-being. Personal and social factors--such as habits, family income, ethnic heritage, body size, advertising, and peer pressure--influence nutritional choices."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.F.1.6",,"Families serve basic health needs, especially for young children. Regardless of the family structure, individuals have families that involve a variety of physical, mental, and social relationships that influence the maintenance and improvement of health."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.F.1.7",,"Sexuality is basic to the physical, mental, and social development of humans. Students should understand that human sexuality involves biological functions, psychological motives, and cultural, ethnic, religious, and technological influences. Sex is a basic and powerful force that has consequences to individuals' health and to society. Students should understand various methods of controlling the reproduction process and that each method has a different type of effectiveness and different health and social consequences."

"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.F.5.1",,"Normal adjustments of earth may be hazardous for humans. Humans live at the interface between the atmosphere driven by solar energy and the upper mantle where convection creates changes in the earth's solid crust. As societies have grown, become stable, and come to value aspects of the environment, vulnerability to natural processes of change has increased. [See Content Standard D (grades 9-12)]"
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.F.5.2",,"Human activities can enhance potential for hazards. Acquisition of resources, urban growth, and waste disposal can accelerate rates of natural change."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.F.5.3",,"Some hazards, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and severe weather, are rapid and spectacular. But there are slow and progressive changes that also result in problems for individuals and societies. For example, change in stream channel position, erosion of bridge foundations, sedimentation in lakes and harbors, coastal erosions, and continuing erosion and wasting of soil and landscapes can all negatively affect society."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.F.5.4",,"Natural and human-induced hazards present the need for humans to assess potential danger and risk. Many changes in the environment designed by humans bring benefits to society, as well as cause risks. Students should understand the costs and trade-offs of various hazards--ranging from those with minor risk to a few people to major catastrophes with major risk to many people. The scale of events and the accuracy with which scientists and engineers can (and cannot) predict events are important considerations."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.F.6.1",,"Science and technology are essential social enterprises, but alone they can only indicate what can happen, not what should happen. The latter involves human decisions about the use of knowledge. [See Content Standard E (grades 9-12) ]"
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.F.6.2",,"Understanding basic concepts and principles of science and technology should precede active debate about the economics, policies, politics, and ethics of various science- and technology-related challenges. However, understanding science alone will not resolve local, national, or global challenges."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.F.6.3",,"Progress in science and technology can be affected by social issues and challenges. Funding priorities for specific health problems serve as examples of ways that social issues influence science and technology."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.F.6.4",,"Individuals and society must decide on proposals involving new research and the introduction of new technologies into society. Decisions involve assessment of alternatives, risks, costs, and benefits and consideration of who benefits and who suffers, who pays and gains, and what the risks are and who bears them. Students should understand the appropriateness and value of basic questions--""What can happen?""--""What are the odds?""--and ""How do scientists and engineers know what will happen?"""
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.F.6.5",,"Humans have a major effect on other species. For example, the influence of humans on other organisms occurs through land use--which decreases space available to other species--and pollution--which changes the chemical composition of air, soil, and water."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.G.1.1",,"Individuals and teams have contributed and will continue to contribute to the scientific enterprise."

"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.G.2.1",,"Science distinguishes itself from other ways of knowing and from other bodies of knowledge."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.G.2.2",,"Scientific explanations must meet certain criteria."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.G.2.3",,"Because all scientific ideas depend on experimental and observational confirmation, all scientific knowledge is, in principle, subject to change as new evidence becomes available."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.G.3.1",,"In history, diverse cultures have contributed scientific knowledge and technologic inventions. Usually, changes in science occur as small modifications in extant knowledge."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.G.3.2",,"Occasionally, there are advances in science and technology that have important and long-lasting effects on science and society."
"SCI.NSES.9-12.CHE.G.3.3",,"The historical perceptive of scientific explanations demonstrates how scientific knowledge changes by evolving over time, almost always building on earlier knowledge."
