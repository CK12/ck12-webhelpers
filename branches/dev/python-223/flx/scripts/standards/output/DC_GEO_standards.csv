Determine a line's slope and x- and y-intercepts from its graph or from a linear equation that represents the line. Find a linear equation describing a line from a graph or a geometric description of the line (e.g., by using the point-slope or slope y-intercept formulas). Explain the significance of a positive, negative, zero, or undefined slope."
