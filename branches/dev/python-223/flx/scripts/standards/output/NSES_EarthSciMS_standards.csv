"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.A.2.4",,"Mathematics is essential in scientific inquiry."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.A.2.5",,"Scientific explanations must adhere to criteria such as a proposed explanation must be logically consistent; it must abide by the rules of evidence; it must be open to questions and possible modification; and it must be based on historical and current scientific knowledge."

"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.B.1.3",,"The nuclear forces that hold the nucleus of an atom together, at nuclear distances, are usually stronger than the electric forces that would make it fly apart. Nuclear reactions convert a fraction of the mass of interacting particles into energy, and they can release much greater amounts of energy than atomic interactions. Fission is the splitting of a large nucleus into smaller pieces. Fusion is the joining of two nuclei at extremely high temperature and pressure, and is the process responsible for the energy of the sun and other stars."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.B.1.4",,"Radioactive isotopes are unstable and undergo spontaneous nuclear reactions, emitting particles and/or wavelike radiation. The decay of any one nucleus cannot be predicted, but a large group of identical nuclei decay at a predictable rate. This predictability can be used to estimate the age of materials that contain radioactive isotopes."

"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.B.5.1",,"The total energy of the universe is constant. Energy can be transferred by collisions in chemical and nuclear reactions, by light waves and other radiations, and in many other ways. However, it can never be destroyed. As these transfers occur, the matter involved becomes steadily less ordered. [See Content Standard C (grades 9-12)]"
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.B.5.2",,
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.B.5.3",,"Heat consists of random motion and the vibrations of atoms, molecules, and ions. The higher the temperature, the greater the atomic or molecular motion."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.B.5.4",,"Everything tends to become less organized and less orderly over time. Thus, in all energy transfers, the overall effect is that the energy is spread out uniformly. Examples are the transfer of energy from hotter to cooler objects by conduction, radiation, or convection and the warming of our surroundings when we burn fuels."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.B.6.1",,"Waves, including sound and seismic waves, waves on water, and light waves, have energy and can transfer energy when they interact with matter. [See Content Standard D (grades 9-12) ]"
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.B.6.2",,"Electromagnetic waves result when a charged object is accelerated or decelerated. Electromagnetic waves include radio waves (the longest wavelength), microwaves, infrared radiation (radiant heat), visible light, ultraviolet radiation, x-rays, and gamma rays. The energy of electromagnetic waves is carried in packets whose magnitude is inversely proportional to the wavelength."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.B.6.3",,"Each kind of atom or molecule can gain or lose energy only in particular discrete amounts and thus can absorb and emit light only at wavelengths corresponding to these amounts. These wavelengths can be used to identify the substance."

"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.C.2.3",,
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.C.3.1",,"Species evolve over time. Evolution is the consequence of the interactions of (1) the potential for a species to increase its numbers, (2) the genetic variability of offspring due to mutation and recombination of genes, (3) a finite supply of the resources required for life, and (4) the ensuing selection by the environment of those offspring better able to survive and leave offspring. [See Unifying Concepts and Processes]"
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.C.3.2",,"The great diversity of organisms is the result of more than 3.5 billion years of evolution that has filled every available niche with life forms."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.C.3.3",,"Natural selection and its evolutionary consequences provide a scientific explanation for the fossil record of ancient life forms, as well as for the striking molecular similarities observed among the diverse species of living organisms."

"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.C.4.2",,"Energy flows through ecosystems in one direction, from photosynthetic organisms to herbivores to carnivores and decomposers."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.C.4.3",,"Organisms both cooperate and compete in ecosystems. The interrelationships and interdependencies of these organisms may generate ecosystems that are stable for hundreds or thousands of years."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.C.4.4",,"Living organisms have the capacity to produce populations of infinite size, but environments and resources are finite. This fundamental tension has profound effects on the interactions between organisms."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.C.4.5",,"Human beings live within the world's ecosystems. Increasingly, humans modify ecosystems as a result of population growth, technology, and consumption. Human destruction of habitats through direct harvesting, pollution, atmospheric changes, and other factors is threatening current global stability, and if not addressed, ecosystems will be irreversibly affected."

"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.C.5.4",,
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.C.5.5",,"The distribution and abundance of organisms and populations in ecosystems are limited by the availability of matter and energy and the ability of the ecosystem to recycle materials."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.C.5.6",,"As matter and energy flows through different levels of organization of living systems--cells, organs, organisms, communities--and between living systems and the physical environment, chemical elements are recombined in different ways. Each recombination results in storage and dissipation of energy into the environment as heat. Matter and energy are conserved in each change."

"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.D.1.1",,"Earth systems have internal and external sources of energy, both of which create heat. The sun is the major external source of energy. Two primary sources of internal energy are the decay of radioactive isotopes and the gravitational energy from the earth's original formation."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.D.1.2",,"The outward transfer of earth's internal heat drives convection circulation in the mantle that propels the plates comprising earth's surface across the face of the globe. [See content Standard B (grades 9-12) ]"
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.D.1.3",,"Heating of earth's surface and atmosphere by the sun drives convection within the atmosphere and oceans, producing winds and ocean currents."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.D.1.4",,"Global climate is determined by energy transfer from the sun at and near the earth's surface. This energy transfer is influenced by dynamic processes such as cloud cover and the earth's rotation, and static conditions such as the position of mountain ranges and oceans."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.D.2.1",,"The earth is a system containing essentially a fixed amount of each stable chemical atom or element. Each element can exist in several different chemical reservoirs. Each element on earth moves among reservoirs in the solid earth, oceans, atmosphere, and organisms as part of geochemical cycles."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.D.2.2",,"Movement of matter between reservoirs is driven by the earth's internal and external sources of energy. These movements are often accompanied by a change in the physical and chemical properties of the matter. Carbon, for example, occurs in carbonate rocks such as limestone, in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide gas, in water as dissolved carbon dioxide, and in all organisms as complex molecules that control the chemistry of life."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.D.3.1",,"The sun, the earth, and the rest of the solar system formed from a nebular cloud of dust and gas 4.6 billion years ago. The early earth was very different from the planet we live on today."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.D.3.2",,"Geologic time can be estimated by observing rock sequences and using fossils to correlate the sequences at various locations. Current methods include using the known decay rates of radioactive isotopes present in rocks to measure the time since the rock was formed."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.D.3.3",,"Interactions among the solid earth, the oceans, the atmosphere, and organisms have resulted in the ongoing evolution of the earth system. We can observe some changes such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions on a human time scale, but many processes such as mountain building and plate movements take place over hundreds of millions of years."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.D.3.4",,"Evidence for one-celled forms of life--the bacteria--extends back more than 3.5 billion years. The evolution of life caused dramatic changes in the composition of the earth's atmosphere, which did not originally contain oxygen."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.D.4.1",,"The origin of the universe remains one of the greatest questions in science. The ""big bang"" theory places the origin between 10 and 20 billion years ago, when the universe began in a hot dense state; according to this theory, the universe has been expanding ever since. [See Content Standard A (grades 9-12)]"
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.D.4.2",,"Early in the history of the universe, matter, primarily the light atoms hydrogen and helium, clumped together by gravitational attraction to form countless trillions of stars. Billions of galaxies, each of which is a gravitationally bound cluster of billions of stars, now form most of the visible mass in the universe."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.D.4.3",,"Stars produce energy from nuclear reactions, primarily the fusion of hydrogen to form helium. These and other processes in stars have led to the formation of all the other elements."

"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.E.2.2",,"Science often advances with the introduction of new technologies."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.E.2.3",,"Creativity, imagination, and a good knowledge base are all required in the work of science and engineering."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.E.2.4",,"Science and technology are pursued for different purposes."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.E.2.5",,"Technological knowledge is often not made public because of patents and the financial potential of the idea or invention. Scientific knowledge is made public."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.F.1.1",,"Hazards and the potential for accidents exist. Regardless of the environment, the possibility of injury, illness, disability, or death may be present. Humans have a variety of mechanisms--sensory, motor, emotional, social, and technological--that can reduce and modify hazards. [See Content Standard C (grades 9-12) ]"
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.F.1.2",,"The severity of disease symptoms is dependent on many factors, such as human resistance and the virulence of the disease-producing organism. Many diseases can be prevented, controlled, or cured. Some diseases, such as cancer, result from specific body dysfunctions and cannot be transmitted."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.F.1.3",,"Personal choice concerning fitness and health involves multiple factors. Personal goals, peer and social pressures, ethnic and religious beliefs, and understanding of biological consequences can all influence decisions about health practices."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.F.1.4",,"An individual's mood and behavior may be modified by substances. The modification may be beneficial or detrimental depending on the motives, type of substance, duration of use, pattern of use, level of influence, and short- and long-term effects. Students should understand that drugs can result in physical dependence and can increase the risk of injury, accidents, and death."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.F.1.5",,"Selection of foods and eating patterns determine nutritional balance. Nutritional balance has a direct effect on growth and development and personal well-being. Personal and social factors--such as habits, family income, ethnic heritage, body size, advertising, and peer pressure--influence nutritional choices."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.F.1.6",,"Families serve basic health needs, especially for young children. Regardless of the family structure, individuals have families that involve a variety of physical, mental, and social relationships that influence the maintenance and improvement of health."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.F.1.7",,"Sexuality is basic to the physical, mental, and social development of humans. Students should understand that human sexuality involves biological functions, psychological motives, and cultural, ethnic, religious, and technological influences. Sex is a basic and powerful force that has consequences to individuals' health and to society. Students should understand various methods of controlling the reproduction process and that each method has a different type of effectiveness and different health and social consequences."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.F.2.1",,"Populations grow or decline through the combined effects of births and deaths, and through emigration and immigration. Populations can increase through linear or exponential growth, with effects on resource use and environmental pollution."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.F.2.2",,"Various factors influence birth rates and fertility rates, such as average levels of affluence and education, importance of children in the labor force, education and employment of women, infant mortality rates, costs of raising children, availability and reliability of birth control methods, and religious beliefs and cultural norms that influence personal decisions about family size."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.F.2.3",,"Populations can reach limits to growth. Carrying capacity is the maximum number of individuals that can be supported in a given environment. The limitation is not the availability of space, but the number of people in relation to resources and the capacity of earth systems to support human beings. Changes in technology can cause significant changes, either positive or negative, in carrying capacity."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.F.3.1",,"Human populations use resources in the environment in order to maintain and improve their existence. Natural resources have been and will continue to be used to maintain human populations."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.F.3.2",,"The earth does not have infinite resources; increasing human consumption places severe stress on the natural processes that renew some resources, and it depletes those resources that cannot be renewed."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.F.3.3",,"Humans use many natural systems as resources. Natural systems have the capacity to reuse waste, but that capacity is limited. Natural systems can change to an extent that exceeds the limits of organisms to adapt naturally or humans to adapt technologically."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.F.4.1",,"Natural ecosystems provide an array of basic processes that affect humans. Those processes include maintenance of the quality of the atmosphere, generation of soils, control of the hydrologic cycle, disposal of wastes, and recycling of nutrients. Humans are changing many of these basic processes, and the changes may be detrimental to humans. [See Content Standard C (grades 9-12) ]"
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.F.4.2",,"Materials from human societies affect both physical and chemical cycles of the earth."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.F.4.3",,"Many factors influence environmental quality. Factors that students might investigate include population growth, resource use, population distribution, overconsumption, the capacity of technology to solve problems, poverty, the role of economic, political, and religious views, and different ways humans view the earth."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.F.5.1",,"Normal adjustments of earth may be hazardous for humans. Humans live at the interface between the atmosphere driven by solar energy and the upper mantle where convection creates changes in the earth's solid crust. As societies have grown, become stable, and come to value aspects of the environment, vulnerability to natural processes of change has increased. [See Content Standard D (grades 9-12)]"
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.F.5.2",,"Human activities can enhance potential for hazards. Acquisition of resources, urban growth, and waste disposal can accelerate rates of natural change."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.F.5.3",,"Some hazards, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and severe weather, are rapid and spectacular. But there are slow and progressive changes that also result in problems for individuals and societies. For example, change in stream channel position, erosion of bridge foundations, sedimentation in lakes and harbors, coastal erosions, and continuing erosion and wasting of soil and landscapes can all negatively affect society."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.F.5.4",,"Natural and human-induced hazards present the need for humans to assess potential danger and risk. Many changes in the environment designed by humans bring benefits to society, as well as cause risks. Students should understand the costs and trade-offs of various hazards--ranging from those with minor risk to a few people to major catastrophes with major risk to many people. The scale of events and the accuracy with which scientists and engineers can (and cannot) predict events are important considerations."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.F.6.1",,"Science and technology are essential social enterprises, but alone they can only indicate what can happen, not what should happen. The latter involves human decisions about the use of knowledge. [See Content Standard E (grades 9-12) ]"
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.F.6.2",,"Understanding basic concepts and principles of science and technology should precede active debate about the economics, policies, politics, and ethics of various science- and technology-related challenges. However, understanding science alone will not resolve local, national, or global challenges."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.F.6.3",,"Progress in science and technology can be affected by social issues and challenges. Funding priorities for specific health problems serve as examples of ways that social issues influence science and technology."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.F.6.4",,"Individuals and society must decide on proposals involving new research and the introduction of new technologies into society. Decisions involve assessment of alternatives, risks, costs, and benefits and consideration of who benefits and who suffers, who pays and gains, and what the risks are and who bears them. Students should understand the appropriateness and value of basic questions--""What can happen?""--""What are the odds?""--and ""How do scientists and engineers know what will happen?"""
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.F.6.5",,"Humans have a major effect on other species. For example, the influence of humans on other organisms occurs through land use--which decreases space available to other species--and pollution--which changes the chemical composition of air, soil, and water."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.G.1.1",,"Individuals and teams have contributed and will continue to contribute to the scientific enterprise."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.G.1.2",,"Scientists have ethical traditions."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.G.1.3",,"Scientists are influenced by societal, cultural, and personal beliefs and ways of viewing the world."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.G.2.1",,"Science distinguishes itself from other ways of knowing and from other bodies of knowledge."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.G.2.2",,"Scientific explanations must meet certain criteria."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.G.2.3",,"Because all scientific ideas depend on experimental and observational confirmation, all scientific knowledge is, in principle, subject to change as new evidence becomes available."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.G.3.1",,"In history, diverse cultures have contributed scientific knowledge and technologic inventions. Usually, changes in science occur as small modifications in extant knowledge."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.G.3.2",,"Occasionally, there are advances in science and technology that have important and long-lasting effects on science and society."
"SCI.NSES.6-8.ESC.G.3.3",,"The historical perceptive of scientific explanations demonstrates how scientific knowledge changes by evolving over time, almost always building on earlier knowledge."
