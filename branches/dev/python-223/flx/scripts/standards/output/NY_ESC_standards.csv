SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.1.1.a,,Most objects in the solar system are in regular and predictable motion.
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.1.1.b,,Nine planets move around the Sun in nearly circular orbits.
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.1.1.c,,"Earth’s coordinate system of latitude and longitude, with the equator and prime meridian as reference lines, is based upon Earth’s rotation and our observation of the Sun and stars."
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.1.1.d,,"Earth rotates on an imaginary axis at a rate of 15 degrees per hour. To people on Earth, this turning of the planet makes it seem as though the Sun, the moon, and the stars are moving around Earth once a day. Rotation provides a basis for our system of local time; meridians of longitude are the basis for time zones."
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.1.1.e,,The Foucault pendulum and the Coriolis effect provide evidence of Earth’s rotation.
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.1.1.f,,Earth’s changing position with regard to the Sun and the moon has noticeable effects.
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.1.1.g,,Seasonal changes in the apparent positions of constellations provide evidence of Earth’s revolution.
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.1.1.h,,The Sun’s apparent path through the sky varies with latitude and season.
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.1.1.i,,"Approximately 70 percent of Earth’s surface is covered by a relatively thin layer of water, which responds to the gravitational attraction of the moon and the Sun with a daily cycle of high and low tides."
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.1.2.a,,The universe is vast and estimated to be over ten billion years old. The current theory is that the universe was created from an explosion called the Big Bang. Evidence for this theory includes:
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.1.2.b,,Stars form when gravity causes clouds of molecules to contract until nuclear fusion of light elements into heavier ones occurs. Fusion releases great amounts of energy over millions of years.
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.1.2.c,,Our solar system formed about five billion years ago from a giant cloud of gas and debris. Gravity caused Earth and the other planets to become layered according to density differences in their materials.
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.1.2.d,,"Asteroids, comets, and meteors are components of our solar system."
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.1.2.e,,"Earth’s early atmosphere formed as a result of the outgassing of water vapor, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and lesser amounts of other gases from its interior."
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.1.2.f,,"Earth’s oceans formed as a result of precipitation over millions of years. The presence of an early ocean is indicated by sedimentary rocks of marine origin, dating back about four billion years."
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.1.2.g,,Earth has continuously been recycling water since the outgassing of water early in its history. This constant recirculation of water at and near Earth’s surface is described by the hydrologic (water) cycle.
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.1.2.h,,The evolution of life caused dramatic changes in the composition of Earth’s atmosphere. Free oxygen did not form in the atmosphere until oxygen-producing organisms evolved.
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.1.2.i,,The pattern of evolution of life-forms on Earth is at least partially preserved in the rock record.
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.1.2.j,,Geologic history can be reconstructed by observing sequences of rock types and fossils to correlate bedrock at various locations.
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.2.1.a,,"Earth systems have internal and external sources of energy, both of which create heat."
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.2.1.b,,"The transfer of heat energy within the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, and Earth’s interior results in the formation of regions of different densities. These density differences result in motion."
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.2.1.c,,"Weather patterns become evident when weather variables are observed, measured, and recorded. These variables include air temperature, air pressure, moisture (relative humidity and dewpoint), precipitation (rain, snow, hail, sleet, etc.), wind speed and direction, and cloud cover."
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.2.1.d,,"Weather variables are measured using instruments such as thermometers, barometers, psychrometers, precipitation gauges, anemometers, and wind vanes."
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.2.1.e,,Weather variables are interrelated. For example:
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.2.1.f,,"Air temperature, dewpoint, cloud formation, and precipitation are affected by the expansion and contraction of air due to vertical atmospheric movement."
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.2.1.g,,"Weather variables can be represented in a variety of formats including radar and satellite images, weather maps (including station models, isobars, and fronts), atmospheric cross-sections, and computer models."
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.2.1.h,,"Atmospheric moisture, temperature and pressure distributions; jet streams, wind; air masses and frontal boundaries; and the movement of cyclonic systems and associated tornadoes, thunderstorms, and hurricanes occur in observable patterns. Loss of property, personal injury, and loss of life can be reduced by effective emergency preparedness."
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.2.1.i,,"Seasonal changes can be explained using concepts of density and heat energy. These changes include the shifting of global temperature zones, the shifting of planetary wind and ocean current patterns, the occurrence of monsoons, hurricanes, flooding, and severe weather."
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.2.1.j,,"Properties of Earth’s internal structure (crust, mantle, inner core, and outer core) can be inferred from the analysis of the behavior of seismic waves (including velocity and refraction)."
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.2.1.k,,The outward transfer of Earth’s internal heat drives convective circulation in the mantle that moves the lithospheric plates comprising Earth’s surface.
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.2.1.l,,"The lithosphere consists of separate plates that ride on the more fluid asthenosphere and move slowly in relationship to one another, creating convergent, divergent, and transform plate boundaries. These motions indicate Earth is a dynamic geologic system."
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.2.1.m,,"Many processes of the rock cycle are consequences of plate dynamics. These include the production of magma (and subsequent igneous rock formation and contact metamorphism) at both subduction and rifting regions, regional metamorphism within subduction zones, and the creation of major depositional basins through down-warping of the crust."
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.2.1.n,,"Many of Earth’s surface features such as mid-ocean ridges/rifts, trenches/subduction zones/island arcs, mountain ranges (folded, faulted, and volcanic), hot spots, and the magnetic and age patterns in surface bedrock are a consequence of forces associated with plate motion and interaction."
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.2.1.o,,"Plate motions have resulted in global changes in geography, climate, and the patterns of organic evolution."
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.2.1.p,,"Landforms are the result of the interaction of tectonic forces and the processes of weathering, erosion, and deposition."
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.2.1.q,,Topographic maps represent landforms through the use of contour lines that are isolines connecting points of equal elevation. Gradients and profiles can be determined from changes in elevation over a given distance.
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.2.1.r,,"Climate variations, structure, and characteristics of bedrock influence the development of landscape features including mountains, plateaus, plains, valleys, ridges, escarpments, and stream drainage patterns."
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.2.1.s,,Weathering is the physical and chemical breakdown of rocks at or near Earth’s surface. Soils are the result of weathering and biological activity over long periods of time.
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.2.1.t,,"Natural agents of erosion, generally driven by gravity, remove, transport, and deposit weathered rock particles. Each agent of erosion produces distinctive changes in the material that it transports and creates characteristic surface features and landscapes. In certain erosional situations, loss of property, personal injury, and loss of life can be reduced by effective emergency preparedness."
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.2.1.u,,The natural agents of erosion include:
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.2.1.v,,"Patterns of deposition result from a loss of energy within the transporting system and are influenced by the size, shape, and density of the transported particles. Sediment deposits may be sorted or unsorted."
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.2.1.w,,Sediments of inorganic and organic origin often accumulate in depositional environments. Sedimentary rocks form when sediments are compacted and/or cemented after burial or as the result of chemical precipitation from seawater.
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.2.2.a,,Insolation (solar radiation) heats Earth’s surface and atmosphere unequally due to variations in:
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.2.2.b,,"The transfer of heat energy within the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, and Earth's surface occurs as the result of radiation, convection, and conduction."
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.2.2.c,,"A location’s climate is influenced by latitude, proximity to large bodies of water, ocean currents, prevailing winds, vegetative cover, elevation, and mountain ranges."
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.2.2.d,,Temperature and precipitation patterns are altered by:
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.3.1.a,,Minerals have physical properties determined by their chemical composition and crystal structure.
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.3.1.b,,Minerals are formed inorganically by the process of crystallization as a result of specific environmental conditions. These include:
SCI.NY.9-12.ESC.3.1.c,,Rocks are usually composed of one or more minerals.
