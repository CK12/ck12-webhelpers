STANDARD ID,TITLE,DESCRIPTION
SCI.OR.9-12.BIO.H.1,,"Structure and Function: A systemâ€™s characteristics, form, and function are attributed to the quantity, type, and nature of its components."
SCI.OR.9-12.BIO.H.1L.1,,Compare and contrast the four types of organic macromolecules. Explain how they compose the cellular structures of organisms and are involved in critical cellular processes.
SCI.OR.9-12.BIO.H.1L.2,,Describe the chemical structure of DNA and its relationship to chromosomes. Explain the role of DNA in protein synthesis.
SCI.OR.9-12.BIO.H.1L.3,,Explain and apply laws of heredity and their relationship to the structure and function of DNA.
SCI.OR.9-12.BIO.H.2,,"Interaction and Change: The components in a system can interact in dynamic ways that may result in change. In systems, changes occur with a flow of energy and/or transfer of matter."
SCI.OR.9-12.BIO.H.2L.1,,Explain how energy and chemical elements pass through systems. Describe how chemical elements are combined and recombined in different ways as they cycle through the various levels of organization in biological systems.
SCI.OR.9-12.BIO.H.2L.2,,Explain how ecosystems change in response to disturbances and interactions. Analyze the relationships among biotic and abiotic factors in ecosystems.
SCI.OR.9-12.BIO.H.2L.3,,Describe how asexual and sexual reproduction affect genetic diversity.
SCI.OR.9-12.BIO.H.2L.4,,"Explain how biological evolution is the consequence of the interactions of genetic variation, reproduction and inheritance, natural selection, and time."
SCI.OR.9-12.BIO.H.2L.5,,Explain how multiple lines of scientific evidence support biological evolution.
SCI.OR.9-12.BIO.H.3,,"Scientific Inquiry: Scientific inquiry is the investigation of the natural world by a systematic process that includes proposing a testable question or hypothesis and developing procedures for questioning, collecting, analyzing, and interpreting multiple forms of accurate and relevant data to produce justifiable evidence-based explanations and new explorations."
SCI.OR.9-12.BIO.H.3S.1,,Based on observations and science principles formulate a question or hypothesis that can be investigated through the collection and analysis of relevant information.
SCI.OR.9-12.BIO.H.3S.2,,"Design and conduct a controlled experiment, field study, or other investigation to make systematic observations about the natural world, including the collection of sufficient and appropriate data."
SCI.OR.9-12.BIO.H.3S.3,,"Analyze data and identify uncertainties. Draw a valid conclusion, explain how it is supported by the evidence, and communicate the findings of a scientific investigation."
SCI.OR.9-12.BIO.H.3S.4,,Identify examples from the history of science that illustrate modification of scientific knowledge in light of challenges to prevailing explanations.
SCI.OR.9-12.BIO.H.4,,"Engineering Design: Engineering design is a process of formulating problem statements, identifying criteria and constraints, proposing and testing possible solutions, incorporating modifications based on test data, and communicating the recommendations."
SCI.OR.9-12.BIO.H.4D.1,,Define a problem and specify criteria for a solution within specific constraints or limits based on science principles. Generate several possible solutions to a problem and use the concept of trade-offs to compare them in terms of criteria and constraints.
SCI.OR.9-12.BIO.H.4D.2,,Create and test or otherwise analyze at least one of the more promising solutions. Collect and process relevant data. Incorporate modifications based on data from testing or other analysis.
SCI.OR.9-12.BIO.H.4D.3,,"Analyze data, identify uncertainties, and display data so that the implications for the solution being tested are clear."
SCI.OR.9-12.BIO.H.4D.4,,"Recommend a proposed solution, identify its strengths and weaknesses, and describe how it is better than alternative designs. Identify further engineering that might be done to refine the recommendations."
SCI.OR.9-12.BIO.H.4D.5,,Describe how new technologies enable new lines of scientific inquiry and are largely responsible for changes in how people live and work.
SCI.OR.9-12.BIO.H.4D.6,,"Evaluate ways that ethics, public opinion, and government policy influence the work of engineers and scientists, and how the results of their work impact human society and the environment."
