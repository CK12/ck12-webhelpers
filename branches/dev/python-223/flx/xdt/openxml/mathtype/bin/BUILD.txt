There are two DLL files in this directory. Both are necessary for mathtypelib.py to work 
correctly.

MT6.dll - This file is shipped with MathType installer and contains all the core 
          functionality provided by MathType

MTSDKDN.dll - A .Net managed code wrapper for the MT6.dll. This file is built from
              compiling the MTSDKDN sample project from MathType SDK samples. The 
              code for this sample is checked into the src/csharp/MTSDKDN directory.

              To rebuild this DLL, open the solution in Visual Studio 2010 C#.
